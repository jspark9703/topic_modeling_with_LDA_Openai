      "['The oral health of older people living in residential aged care facilities has been widely recognised as inadequate. The aim of this paper is to identify barriers to effective engagement of health-care providers in oral care in residential aged care facilities. A literature review was conducted using MEDline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete and PsychInfo between 2000 and 2013, with a grey literature search of government and non-government organisation policy papers, conference proceedings and theses. Keywords included: dental/oral care, residential aged care, health-care providers, barriers, constraints, and limitations. A thematic framework was used to synthesise the literature according to a series of oral health-care provision barriers, health-care provider barriers, and cross-sector collaborative barriers. A range of system, service and practitioner level barriers were identified that could impede effective communication/collaboration between different health-care providers, residents and carers regarding oral care, and these were further impeded by internal barriers at each level. Findings indicated several areas for investigation and consideration regarding policy and practice improvements. While further research is required, some key areas should be addressed if oral health care in residential aged care services is to be improved.', 'This paper explores how one health care purchasing coalition in Minnesota, the Buyers Health Care Action Group (BHCAG), has taken an active role in restructuring its local health care market. BHCAG started with the belief that the consumer should be the motivating force in health care delivery. Unfortunately, providing consumers with the information and incentives they need to make informed, effective health care decisions has triggered numerous problems. This paper examines groups of providers who network to form care systems, and explores the roles of consumers, employers, and health plans in the current market. It identifies specific methods for gathering data and distributing information to the consumer, and discusses the problems associated with attempting to implement quality improvement, as well as the questions that arise when the market does not support those improvements.', \"Introduction: Having a health care home has been shown to be associated with positive health outcomes for children with special health care needs (CSHCN), but its relationship to parental coping has not been established. The purpose of this study was to explore the health care home as a process of care related to parental coping with day-to-day demands of raising a CSHCN. Method: Data are from a sample of 18,352 CSHCN in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. Using the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as a framework, this secondary analysis explored relationships between child and household factors and parental coping among CSHCN with and without a health care home. Results: CSHCN in a health care home were more likely to have parents who were coping well. Parents who received sufficient care coordination were more satisfied with provider communication, and those who reported that care was family-centered reported better coping. Discussion: Results suggest that the health care home represents a process of care that may help families manage the daily demands of caring for CSHCN through family-centered care, provider-to-provider communication, and provision of care coordination. J Pediatr Health Care. (2012) 26, 266-275.\", 'The role of health care inequalities in social inequalities in health should be reconsidered since the quality of health care varies according to the social status. Some of the health care inequalities are constructed by not taking account of health inequalities in the development of programs or recommendations of medical practice and thus ending up with management procedures that do not reduce inequalities to a minimum but even contribute to increasing them. Other health care inequalities are due to omission, linked to the operating inertia of a health care system that does not recognize these inequalities and has no plan to catch them up. To reverse this situation it seems necessary to act at the three levels of the health care system: to change the clinical paradigm at the micro level, tackle the organizations issues at the meso level, and pursue the reform of the entire health care system at the macro level.

Materials and Methods: Pilot, prospective cohort study of 50 surrogates of adult, mechanically ventilated patients surveyed on days 1, 3, and 7 of ICU admission. Results: Responses on the Health Care System Distrust Scale on day 1 ranged from 9 to 34 (possible range 9-45, with higher scores indicating more distrust), with a mean and SD of 20.3 +/- 6.9. Factor analysis demonstrated a 2-factor structure, corresponding to the domains of values and competence. Cronbach alpha for the overall scale was .83, for the competence subscale, .76, and for the values subscale, .74. Health-care system distrust was inversely correlated with trust in ICU physicians (Pearson coefficient - .63). When evaluated over the course of each patient's ICU stay, health-care system distrust ratings decreased by 0.31 per patient-day (95% CI 0.55-0.06, P = .015). Correlation between health-care system distrust and trust in ICU physicians decreased slightly over time. Conclusions: Among surrogates in the ICU, the Health Care System Distrust Scale has high internal consistency and convergent validity. There was substantial variability in surrogates' trust in the healthcare system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recommendations were developed and refined based on expert input, evidence review, and stakeholder engagement. Participating stakeholders included experts from academia, health care organizations, industry, and government.Study DesignExpert group consensus, informed by stakeholder engagement and targeted evidence review.Data Collection/Extraction MethodsPriority themes were derived iteratively through (1) brainstorming and idea reduction, (2) targeted evidence review of candidate themes, (3) determination of preliminary themes; (4) input on preliminary themes from stakeholders attending AHRQ's 2022 Health Equity Summit; and (5) and refinement of themes based on that input. The final set of research and action recommendations was determined by authors' consensus.Principal FindingsHealth care delivery systems have contributed to racial and ethnic disparities in health care. High quality research is needed to inform health care delivery systems approaches to undo systemic barriers and inequities. We identified six priority themes for research; (1) institutional leadership, culture, and workforce; (2) data-driven, culturally tailored care; (3) health equity targeted performance incentives; (4) health equity-informed approaches to health system consolidation and access; (5) whole person care; (6) and whole community investment. We also suggest cross-cutting themes regarding research workforce and research timelines.ConclusionsAs the nation's primary health services research agency, AHRQ can advance equitable delivery of health care by funding research and disseminating evidence to help transform the organization and delivery of health care.\", \"The objective was to estimate the association between health care expenditures and implementation of preventive mental health programs by local health departments (LHDs). Multilevel nationally representative data sets were linked to test the hypothesis that LHDs' provision of preventive mental health programs was associated with cost savings. A generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution and state-fixed effects was used to estimate the association between LHDs' mental illness prevention services and total health care expenditures per person per year for adults aged 18 years and older. The main outcome measure was the annual total health care expenditure per person. The findings indicated that LHD provision of population-based prevention of mental illness was associated with an $824 reduction (95% confidence interval: -$1,562.94 to -$85.42, P < 0.05) in annual health care costs per person, after controlling for individual, LHD, community, and state characteristics. LHDs can play a critical role in establishing an integrated health care model. Their impact, however, has often been underestimated or neglected. Results showed that a small investment in LHDs may yield substantial cost savings at the societal level. The findings of this research are critical to inform policy decisions for the expansion of the Public Health 3.0 infrastructure.\", \"Purpose: This qualitative descriptive study explored Jordanian health care providers' perceptions of the health care that they provide for post-partum mothers. Methods: Thirty Jordanian health care providers (physicians, nurses and midwives) participated in three focus group discussions. A content analysis approach was used to analyse the data as appropriate for descriptive qualitative inquiry. Findings: Health care providers indicated that the care they deliver includes breastfeeding, family planning, childcare and laboratory tests. Health care providers reflected confidence in the care given but indicated the need for continuing education, more resources and expressions of appreciation. Conclusions: Findings provide insights into Jordanian health care providers' perspectives on post-partum health care and emphasized the importance of enhancing utilization of such care in Jordan. It is suggested that the Jordanian Ministry of Health develop a comprehensive plan of educational offerings for providers, with a standardized educational programme for post-partum women. It is essential that all health care facilities provide high-quality post-partum health care that meets the needs of the maternal/infant dyad. Like all qualitative descriptive studies, generalizability of the results may be limited to similar Situations and cultures.\", 'The objective of this study is to examine the causal effect of health care utilization on unmet health care needs. An IV approach deals with the endogeneity between the use of health care services and unmet health care, using the presence of drug insurance and the number of physicians by health region as instruments. We employ three cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey confidential master files (2003, 2005, and 2014). We find a robustly negative relationship between health care use and unmet health care needs. One more visit to a medical doctor on average decreases the probability of reporting unmet health care needs by 0.014 points. The effect is negative for the women-only group whereas it is statistically insignificant for men; similarly, the effect is negative for urban dwellers but insignificant for rural ones. Health care use reduces the likelihood of reporting unmet health care. Policies that encourage the use of health care services, like increasing the coverage of public drug insurance and increasing after hours accessibility of physicians, can help reduce the likelihood of unmet health care.', 'The United States is one of a very few high-income countries that does not guarantee every person the right to health care. Residents of the United States pay more out-of-pocket for increasingly worse outcomes. People of color, those who have lower incomes, and those who live in rural areas have less access to health care and are therefore at even greater risk for poor health. Universal health care, a term for various models of health care systems that provide care for every resident of a given country, will help move the United States toward higher quality, more affordable, and more equitable care. This article defines a reproductive justice and human rights foundation for universal health care, explores how health insurance has worked historically in the United States, identifies the economic reasons for implementing universal health care, and discusses international models that could be used domestically.', \"Introduction: Although recent health care reforms will expand insurance coverage for U. S. children, disparities regarding access to pediatric care persist, even among the insured. We investigated the separate and combined effects of having health insurance and a usual source of care (USC) on children's receipt of health care services. Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of the nationally representative 2002-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from children (<= 18 years of age) who had at least one health care visit and needed any additional care, tests, or treatment in the preceding year (n = 20,817). Results: Approximately 88.1% of the study population had both a USC and insurance; 1.1% had neither one; 7.6% had a USC only, and 3.2% had insurance only. Children with both insurance and a USC had the fewest unmet needs. Among insured children, those with no USC had higher rates of unmet needs than did those with a USC. Discussion: Expansions in health insurance are essential; however, it is also important for every child to have a USC. New models of practice could help to concurrently achieve these goals.

Method: A scoping review was performed. First, relevant studies were identified in 4 databases (n = 74). Independent reviewers selected eligible studies. Numerical and thematic analyses were performed to draft a preliminary framework including a definition. Next, the feasibility of the framework and definition was explored by physical therapy primary health care organization experts. Results: Numerical and thematic data on health care quality and context-specific performance resulted in a health care value framework for physical therapy primary health care organizations-including a definition of health care value, namely to continuously attain physical therapy primary health care organization-centered outcomes in coherence with patient- and stakeholder-centered outcomes, leveraged by an organization's capacity for change. Conclusion: Prior literature mainly discussed health care quality and context-specific performance for primary health care organizations separately. The current study met the need for a value-based framework, feasible for physical therapy primary health care organizations, which are for a large part micro or small. It also solves the omissions of incoherent literature and existing frameworks on continuous health care quality and context-specific performance. Future research is recommended on longitudinal exploration of the HV (health care value) framework.\", 'Informal care by adult children is a common form of long-term care for older adults and can reduce medical expenditures if it substitutes for formal care. We address how informal care by all children affects formal care, which is critically important given demographic trends and the many policies proposed to promote informal care. We examine the 1998 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and 1995 Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest-Old Panel Survey (AHEAD) using two-part utilization models. Instrumental variables (IV) estimation controls for the simultaneity of informal and formal care. Informal care reduces home health care use and delays nursing home entry. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Required is the integration of health and social care, beyond traditional health care services to address social determinants. This study investigates key care components to support complex patients and their families in the community. Methods: Expert panel focus groups with 24 care providers, working in health and social care sectors across Toronto, Ontario, Canada were conducted. Patient vignettes illustrating significant health and social care needs were presented to participants. The vignettes prompted discussions on i) how best to meet complex care needs in the community and ii) the barriers to delivering care to this population. Results: Categories to support care needs of complex patients and their families included i) relationships as the foundation for care, ii) desired processes and structures of care, and iii) barriers and workarounds for desired care. Discussion and Conclusions: Meeting the needs of the population who require health and social care requires time to develop authentic relationships, broadening the membership of the care team, communicating across sectors, co-locating health and social care, and addressing the barriers that prevent providers from engaging in these required practices.', \"Objectives. To describe the health care system and health care delivery in Greenland. Study design and method. This was a literature study that included literature and articles searched in PubMed published from 1989 to 2009 about health care in Greenland. Results. The health care system is a publicly financed governmental responsibility. Its major challenges are limited economic resources, Greenland's demographic structure, rapid epidemiological changes, increased public demand for specialized treatment, difficulty in recruiting professionals and the economic burden imposed by around-the-clock maintenance of specialized staff in sparsely populated areas. To meet these challenges, a public health program focusing on health promotion and prevention, educational initiatives to improve recruitment and a system reorientation moving towards larger health care regions is proposed to be gradually implemented from 2010. One fundamental component of this plan is tying the system together with a telemedicine system and in the future also with a joint electronic patient file system. The importance of better surveillance and monitoring of health has been recognized, while securing best clinical practice and implementing better steering instruments on resource allocation and quality are areas needing focus in the future. Conclusion. Many of the challenges for the Greenlandic health care system are being addressed with promising strategies, but only the future will show whether they are successful.

This paper examines the relationship between health care system characteristics, other social and economic characteristics of counties in a mid-western U.S. state and an individual's ability to meet health care needs over a 12-month period. We conclude that policy interventions are needed that look beyond health resource allocation to address problems in health care access that contribute to inequities in health.

Aims: The objective of the paper is to present for the first time in public national health-care workforce census data for the first two years of the economic recession and the adopted bailout mechanism (2010 and 2011) (a) to evaluate the adequacy of the governmental effort in terms of organization and management of the health-care workforce in PHC; and (b) to identify constraints and opportunities for the development of an integrated PHC ensuring access to health-care services for all. Methods: Data were drawn from the national project 'Health Monitoring Indicators System: Health Map' coordinated scientifically by the National School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology. They referred to the 202 PHCs and their regional surgeries (with 98% response rate). Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were used for the analysis. Findings: The findings pointed that PHC absorbs a very limited part of the national health system's workforce. Important inequalities in the numerical and geographical allocation of the PHC health workforce specialties across the country in favor of the medical profession and to the detriment of rural areas and the islands were identified, raising concerns about the policymakers' ability to meet the emerging needs of the population, as the retrospective study of the health-care workforce, since 2010, reveals that the numerical and per type allocations remained almost unchanged. These results were in line with previous studies showcasing the lack of holistic approach for PHC questioning the restrictive spending policy (ie, salary and benefit cuts for the health-care professionals, important discharges and nonrenewal of the personnel) adopted in the public health-care sector.\", \"Aim: The aim of this paper is to examine Canadian key informants' perceptions of intrapersonal (within an individual) and interpersonal (among individuals) factors that influence successful primary care and public health collaboration. Background: Primary health care systems can be strengthened by building stronger collaborations between primary care and public health. Although there is literature that explores interpersonal factors that can influence successful inter-organizational collaborations, a few of them have specifically explored primary care and public health collaboration. Furthermore, no papers were found that considered factors at the intrapersonal level. This paper aims to explore these gaps in a Canadian context. Methods: This interpretative descriptive study involved key informants (service providers, managers, directors, and policy makers) who participated in one h telephone interviews to explore their perceptions of influences on successful primary care and public health collaboration. Transcripts were analyzed using NVivo 9. Findings: A total of 74 participants [from the provinces of British Columbia (n = 20); Ontario (n = 19); Nova Scotia (n = 21), and representatives from other provinces or national organizations (n = 14)] participated. Five interpersonal factors were found that influenced public health and primary care collaborations including: (1) trusting and inclusive relationships; (2) shared values, beliefs and attitudes; (3) role clarity; (4) effective communication; and (5) decision processes. There were two influencing factors found at the intrapersonal level: (1) personal qualities, skills and knowledge; and (2) personal values, beliefs, and attitudes. A few differences were found across the three core provinces involved. There were several complex interactions identified among all inter and intra personal influencing factors: One key factor - effective communication - interacted with all of them. Results support and extend our understanding of what influences successful primary care and public health collaboration at these levels and are important considerations in building and sustaining primary care and public health collaborations.\", \"Background: Adequate care for individuals living with chronic illnesses calls for a healthcare system redesign, moving from acute, disease-centered to patient-centered models. The aim of this study was to identify Belgian stakeholders' perceptions on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the healthcare system for people with chronic diseases in Belgium. Methods: Four focus groups were held with stakeholders from the micro and meso level, in addition to two interviews with stakeholders who could not attend the focus group sessions. Data collection and the discussion were based on the Chronic Care model. Thematic analysis of the transcripts allowed for the identification of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the current health care system with focus on chronic care. Results: Informants stressed the overall good quality of the acute health care system and the level of reimbursement of care as an important strength of the current system. In contrast, the lack of integration of care was identified as one of the biggest weaknesses of today's health care system, along with the unclear definitions of the roles and functions of health professionals involved in care processes. Patient education to support self-management exists for patients with diabetes and/or terminal kidney failure but not for those living with other or multiple chronic conditions. The current overall fee-for-service system is a barrier to integrated care, as are the lack of incentives for integrated care. Attending multidisciplinary meetings, for example, is underfinanced to date. Finally, clinical information systems lack interoperability, which further impedes the information flow across settings and disciplines. Conclusion: Our study's methods allowed for the identification of problematic domains in the health system for people living with chronic conditions. These findings provided useful insights surrounding perceived priorities. This methodology may inspire other countries faced with the challenge of drafting reforms to tackle the issue of chronic care.\", \"Many rural veterans receive care in community settings but could benefit from VA services for certain needs, presenting an opportunity for coordination across systems. This article details the Collaborative Systems of Care (CSC) program, a novel, nurse-led care coordination program identifying and connecting veterans presenting for care in a Federally Qualified Health Center to VA behavioral health and other services based upon the veteran's preferences and eligibility. The CSC program systematically identifies veteran patients, screens for common behavioral health issues, explores VA eligibility for interested veterans, and facilitates coordination with VA to improve healthcare access. While the present program focuses on behavioral health, there is a unique emphasis on assisting veterans with the eligibility and enrollment process and coordinating additional care tailored to the patient. As VA expands its presence in community care, opportunities for VA-community care coordination will increase, making the development and implementation of such interventions important.\", \"Health literacy is fundamental if people are to successfully manage their own health. This requires a range of skills and knowledge about health and health care, including finding, understanding, interpreting and communicating health information, seeking of appropriate care and making critical health decisions. A primary health system that is appropriate and universally accessible requires an active agenda based on research of approaches to address low health literacy, while health care providers should be alert to the widespread problems of health literacy which span all age levels. 7-bis article reviews the progress made in Australia on health literacy in primary health care since health literacy was included in Australia's health goals and targets in the mid-1990s. A database search of published literature was conducted to identify existing examples of health literacy programs in Australia. Considerable work has been done on mental health literacy, and research into chronic disease self-management with CALD communities, which, includes health literacy, is under way. However, the lack of breadth in research has led to a knowledge base that is patchy. The few Australian studies located on health literacy research together with the data about general literacy in Australia suggests the need for much, more work to be done to increase our knowledge base about health literacy, in order to develop appropriate resources and tools to manage low health literacy in primary health settings.\", \"Medicare is central to accessing health care in Australia, yet many asylum seekers are ineligible for this scheme. In NSW, Medicare ineligible asylum seekers have some access to public health care under the Medicare Ineligible Asylum Seekers - Provision of Specified Public Health Services policy. This policy was updated in November 2020 to clarify services where a fee waiver applies for asylum seekers without Medicare. We examined the experiences of Medicare ineligible asylum seekers in accessing health care in New South Wales (NSW) in light of the revised policy. Employing qualitative methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with asylum seekers (n = 7) and service providers (n = 6) in South Western Sydney. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and the socio-ecological model was used to interpret the data. Participants identified that chronic and mental health conditions are the main health issues for asylum seekers. Factors across the four levels of the socio-ecological model were identified as influencing the health care of asylum seekers, including a lack of awareness about health care rights at the individual level, support from relatives and friends at the interpersonal level, providers' lack of awareness of fee waivers at the organizational level and limited access to primary health care at the policy level. The results imply that Medicare ineligible asylum seekers in NSW do not have optimal access to health care which may worsen existing health disparities. Educational initiatives that improve service providers' and asylum seekers' awareness of the revised policy are needed to improve asylum seeker health equity in NSW.\", 'Objective To disentangle the relationships among food insecurity, health care utilization, and health care expenditures. Data Sources/Study Setting We use national data on 13 465 adults (age >= 18) from the 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the first year of the food insecurity measures. Study Design We employ two-stage empirical models (probit for any health care use/expenditure, ordinary least squares, and generalized linear models for amount of utilization/expenditure), controlling for demographics, health insurance, poverty status, chronic conditions, and other predictors. Principal Findings Our results show that the likelihood of any health care expenditure (total, inpatient, emergency department, outpatient, and pharmaceutical) is higher for marginal, low, and very low food secure individuals. Relative to food secure households, very low food secure households are 5.1 percentage points (P < .001) more likely to have any health care expenditure, and have total health care expenditures that are 24.8 percent higher (P = .011). However, once we include chronic conditions in the models (ie, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, emphysema, high cholesterol, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and asthma), these underlying health conditions mitigate the differences in expenditures by food insecurity status (only the likelihood of any having any health care expenditure for very low food secure households remains statistically significant). Conclusions Policy makers and government agencies are focused on addressing deficiencies in social determinants of health and the resulting impacts on health status and health care utilization. Our results indicate that chronic conditions are strongly associated with food insecurity and higher health care spending. Efforts to alleviate food insecurity should consider the dual burden of chronic conditions. Finally, future research can address specific mechanisms underlying the relationships between food security, health, and health care.', 'BackgroundPrimary health care (PHC) is the ideal setting to provide integrated services centred on the person and to implement health promotion (HP) activities. ObjectiveTo identify proposals to approach HP in the context of primary care according to health-care users aged 45-75years, key community informants and primary care centre (PCC) workers. MethodsDescriptive-interpretive qualitative research with 276 participants from 14 PCC of seven Spanish regions. A theoretical sampling was used for selection. A total of 25 discussion groups, two triangular groups and 30 semi-structured interviews were carried out. A thematic interpretive contents analysis was carried out. ResultsParticipants consider that HP is not solely a matter for the health sector and they emphasize intersectoral collaboration. They believe that it is important to strengthen community initiatives and to create a healthy social environment that encourages greater responsibility and participation of health-care users in decisions regarding their own health and better management of public services and resources. HP, care in the community and demedicalization should be priorities for PHC. Participants propose organizational changes in the PCC to improve HP. PCC workers are aware that HP falls within the scope of their responsibilities and propose to increase their training, motivation, competences and knowledge of the social environment. Informants emphasize that HP should be person-centred approach and empathic communication. HP activities should be appealing, ludic and of proven effectiveness. ConclusionsAccording to a socio-ecological and intersectoral model, PHC services must get actively involved in HP together with community and through outreach interventions.', \"Background Ukraine is reforming its health care system to improve quality of health care. Insight into how primary health care managers perceive quality is important for the ongoing reform as well as for the improvement of medical services. Methods An online survey was conducted as part of the Ukrainian-Swiss project Medical Educational Development in April-May 2019 based on the contact list of USAID project Health Reform Support, and additionally on the database of the National Health Service of Ukraine and other channels. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis. Results In total, 302 health care managers took part in the study. The majority of primary health care managers perceive quality in health care as process quality. They associate quality mostly with compliance to standards. At the same time, primary health care managers prefer to assess outcome quality via a system of indicators and feedback. There appears to be a lack of consensus about health care quality. This may be due to a lack of awareness of the national strategy for better quality of health care service. Conclusions Our study provides new insights into primary care managers' perceptions of health care quality in Ukraine. The absence of a clear consensus about quality complicates the discussion about quality and how to measure quality in health care. This appears to be one of the obstacles to system-wide quality improvement.\", 'ObjectivesThis study explores the relationship between end-of-life care costs and place of death across different health and social care sectors.MethodsWe used a linked local government and health data of East London residents (n=4661) aged 50 or over, deceased between 2016 and 2020. Individuals who died in hospital were matched to those who died elsewhere according to a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. We reported mean healthcare costs and 95% CIs by care sectors over the 12-month period before death. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate if the role of place of death differs according to long-term conditions and age.ResultsWe found that mean difference in total cost between hospital and non-hospital decedents was & POUND;4565 (95% CI & POUND;3132 to & POUND;6046). Hospital decedents were associated with higher hospital cost (& POUND;5196, & POUND;4499 to & POUND;5905), higher mental healthcare cost (& POUND;283, & POUND;78 to & POUND;892) and lower social care cost (-& POUND;838, -& POUND;1,209 to -& POUND;472), compared with individuals who died elsewhere. Subgroup analysis shows that the association between place of death and healthcare costs differs by age and long-term conditions, including cancer, mental health and cardiovascular diseases.ConclusionThis study suggests that trajectories of end-of-life healthcare costs vary by place of death in a differential way across health and social care sectors. High hospital burden for cancer patients may be alleviated by strengthening healthcare provision in less cost-intensive settings, such as community and social care.', \"Objective. To examine the relationship between features of managed care organizations (MCOs) and health care use patterns by children. Data Sources. Telephone survey data from 2,223 parents of children with special health care needs, MCO-administrator interview data, and health care claims data. Study Design. Cross-sectional survey data from families about the number of consequences of their children's conditions and from MCO administrators about their plans' organizational features were used. Indices reflecting the MCO characteristics were developed using data reduction techniques. Hierarchical models were developed to examine the relationship between child sociodemographic and health characteristics and the MCO indices labeled: Pediatrician Focused (PF) Index, Specialist Focused (SF) Index, and Fee-for-Service (FFS) Index, and outpatient use rates and charges, inpatient admissions, emergency room (ER) visits, and specialty consultations. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. The telephone and MCO-administrator survey data were linked to the enrollment and claims files. Principal Findings. The child's age, gender, and condition consequences were consistent predictor variables related to health care use and charges. The PF Index was associated with decreased outpatient use rates and charges and decreased inpatient admissions. The SF Index was associated with increased ER visits and decreased specialty consultations, while the FFS Index was associated with increased outpatient use rates and charges. Conclusion. After controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics, the PF, SF, and FFS indices were significantly associated with children's health care use patterns.\", \"BackgroundEfforts to progress oral healthcare reform can be challenging with competing interests of governments and service providers to achieve the intended outcomes. The value-based health care approach has been adopted in many areas of healthcare but has had limited applications to oral healthcare systems. Dental Health Services Victoria, an Australian state government funded entity, commenced its journey to value-based health care in 2016, to shift away from traditional dental service models that reward activity and volume towards a stronger emphasis on value and outcomes. AimsTo maintain the value-based health care agenda focus, Dental Health Services Victoria developed three key principles, which can be adopted by other organisations engaged in reforming oral healthcare, to improve the oral health for the population it serves. Materials & MethodsIn 2018, Dental Health Services Victoria developed a value-based health care framework, which has informed strategic organisation priorities for action. In 2023, the following three key principles are identified as being essential to support the operationalisation and development of effective models of oral healthcare: Principle 1 - Care is co-designed with the person or population Principle 2 - Prevention and early intervention are prioritised. Principle 3 - Consistent measurement of health outcomes and costs are embedded. DiscussionThe exploration of the three key principles is an important communication tool to translate value-based health care into practice with key stakeholders. Further work is required to socialise them to within dental teams. ConclusionOrganisations looking to commence the value-based health care agenda can apply Dental Health Services Victoria's three key principles as a first step.\", 'Background: The objective of the Balearic Islands Palliative Care (PC) Program is to improve the quality of PC through a shared model consisting of primary health care professionals, home-based PC teams, and PC units in hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patients with advanced cancer and other terminal diseases benefit from early identification and proactive PC. We will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention in which a PC leader is established in the primary health care center, and assess the effect of this intervention on the early identification of patients in need of PC, the efficient use of health care services, and direct health care costs. Methods: Design: A two-arm cluster randomized clinical trial of 30 Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) in Mallorca (Spain), in which each center was randomized to an intervention arm or a usual care arm. We expect that the number of patients identified as suitable for PC (including non-oncological PC) is at least 5% greater in the intervention arm. Sample size: A total of 4640 deceased patients. Outcomes will be assessed by a blinded external review of the electronic records. Interventions: General practitioners (GPs) and nurse leaders in PC for each PHCC will be appointed. These leaders will help promote PC training of colleagues, improve symptom management and psychological support of patients, and evaluate the complexity of individual cases so that these cases receive assistance from PC home-based teams. Measurements: Early identification (>90 days before death), evaluation of case complexity, level of case complexity (with referral to a home-based PC team), use and cost of hospital and primary care services, and quality of life during the last month of life (>= 2 emergency room visits, >= 2 hospital admissions, >= 14 days of hospitalization). Discusion: PC leaders in primary care teams will improve the early identification of patients eligible for PC. This initiative could improve the quality of end-of-life care and utilization of hospital resources.', 'Objective: To evaluate an innovative rural service offering comprehensive primary health care for mental health service clients. Design: A formative evaluation using mixed methods. Setting: A rural NSW community. Participants: Fifteen health care providers and 120 adult clients. Intervention: A monthly clinic held in a general practice to provide primary health care for clients of the community mental health team. Main outcome measures: Client utilisation and clinic activity data. Provider views of service effectiveness, possible improvements and sustainability. Results: The GP Clinic has operated successfully for 2.5 years without access block. Some 52% of clients had no physical illness and 82% were referred to other health and community services. In total, 40% continued to attend the clinic while 32% went on to consult a GP independently. Client access to care improved as did collaboration between the community mental health team and primary care providers. Conclusion: The GP Clinic is a straightforward and flexible service model that could be used more widely.', \"BackgroundPeople with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Primary prevention and health maintenance are therefore imperative. Evidence has shown that prediabetes can be prevented or delayed with behavioural change, mainly in eating habits and physical activity. Interventions that use a person-centered approach can lead to improvements in self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research that engages healthcare professionals and people with prediabetes in constructing and implementing preventive programs. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe how healthcare professionals perceive prediabetes, the current challenges in its detection and treatment, and what is needed to improve quality of care.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted in Region Stockholm. A total of 26 primary health care professionals participated in individual interviews: 15 diabetes nurses and/or district nurses, five general practitioners, five dietitians, and one physiotherapist. Interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis.ResultsThe analysis revealed two main themes that emphasize the need to make prediabetes more visible in primary health care. Despite the healthcare professionals' engagement and their motivation to improve prediabetes care, ad hoc practices and the absence of clear screening guidelines and referral pathways made it harder to focus on primary prevention. Supporting professionals in implementing structured care for people with prediabetes might encourage more efficient interprofessional collaboration and contribute to better strategies for promoting behavioural change.ConclusionsEstablishing prediabetes care guidelines, supporting health care professionals ' knowledge and skills in prediabetes care, and implementing interprofessional referral pathways are some steps to enhance prediabetes detection and care precedence in primary health care. These steps could lead to more preventive care and ensure patient safety and health care equity.\", \"Introduction: Aging is associated with multiple chronic conditions. In older age, health needs and demand for health services utilization increase. There are limited data in Nepal on the health care utilization as well as health care costs among the elderly population. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the factors hindering access to health care among Nepalese older adults. Our study aims to explore the health care utilization and expenditure among Nepali older adults. Method: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 401 older adults residing in Pokhara Lekhnath metropolitan of Nepal. The survey tool was adapted from the Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (SAGE)'s questions on Health Care Utilization. The predictors of health care utilization were assessed in binary logistic regression models. Results: Study participants, mean (+/- SD) age 70.2 (+/- 8.0) years, had various preexisting conditions such as hypertension (37.7 %), gastritis (28.4 %), asthma (25.4 %), and arthritis (23.4%) reported in the past 12 months but only 70% visited a health facility. A notable proportion (30%) of participants didn't utilize health services despite having a health problem. The utilization of out-patient and in-patient health services were 87.5 and 14.6% respectively. The use of private health facilities (56.4%) was high compared to the use of government health facilities (35.7%). Privileged ethnicity, living with a partner, higher annual income, knowledge of social insurance, and multi-morbidity were associated with higher odds of utilizing health services. Participants of privileged ethnicity, with higher household income, attending private health facility, and having multi-morbidities had significantly higher out of pocket health expenditures. Conclusions: A notable proportion of elderly participants did not utilize health services despite having a health problem. The public health system must develop effective strategies to attract this segment of the society. High dependency on private health facilities, as noted in the study, will only lead toward higher out of pocket health expenditures. The health benefits of regular health screenings must be disseminated among the elderly population. Developing quality and affordable health care services for older adults to ensure equity in accessibility will be a major task for the public health system in Nepal.\", \"AimThis paper describes the policy context and approaches taken to improve access to primary health care in Australia by supporting nurses to deliver improved integrated care meeting community needs. ContextIn Primary Health Care (PHC), the nursing workforce are predominantly employed in the general practice sector. Despite evidence that nurse-led models of care can bridge traditional treatment silos in the provision of specialised and coordinated care, PHC nurses' scope of practice varies dramatically. Nurse-led models of care are imperative for rural and remote populations that experience workforce shortages and barriers to accessing health care. Existing barriers include policy constraints, limited organisational structures, education and financing models. ApproachThe Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association (APNA) received funding to implement nurse-led clinics as demonstration projects. The clinics enable PHC nurses to work to their full scope of practice, improve continuity of care and increase access to health care in under serviced locations. We reviewed a range of peer-reviewed literature, policy documents, grey literature and APNA provided sources, particularly those relevant to rural and remote populations. We argue more focus is needed on how to address variations in the scope of practice of the rural and remote PHC nursing workforce. ConclusionDespite growing evidence for the effectiveness of nurse-led models of care, significant policy and financial barriers continue to inhibit PHC nurses working to their full scope of practice. If their potential to transform health care and increase access to health services is to be realised these barriers must be addressed.\", 'This paper investigates whether managed care ameliorates or aggravates ethnic and racial health care disparities in Medicare. First, we analyze the choice of type of insurance made by Medicare enrollees to see if minorities are more likely to choose the managed care alternative. Second, we study the differential effect of managed care on disparities using several measures of access, use and cost of services. Both analyses are conducted on two independent data sets, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. We conclude that relative to Whites, minorities are at least as well off-in terms of benefits and costs-in Medicare managed care as in Medicare traditional indemnity plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Methods. A 3-year experimental study was conducted in 5 California counties and 111 licensed child care centers (73 intervention, 38 comparison) participated at the baseline and post-intervention times. Trained research assistants conducted objective observations with a Policies Checklist and Health and Safety Checklist, which were composed of key national health and safety standards. Results. At baseline, both groups were not significantly different on the Policies Checklist and the Health and Safety Checklist. At the post intervention time, intervention centers had significantly more and higher-quality written health and safety policies on 9 of the 10 policies rated (medication administration. care of mildly ill children, exclusion of ill children, cleaning and sanitizing, handwashing, daily health checks, inclusion of children with special needs, emergency preparedness, staff health) than comparison centers. At the post-intervention time, intervention centers improved their health and safety practices in the areas of emergency preparedness and handwashing, controlling for consultation model, time in study, and director turnover. Both groups improved their indoor and outdoor facilities and overall Health and Safety Checklist means. Conclusions. Child care health consultation programs can improve the written health and safety policies and may improve practices in child care centers.\", 'Background: The medical home (MH) model has prompted increasing attention given its potential to improve quality of care while reducing health expenditures. Objectives: We compare overall and specific health care expenditures in Belgium, from the third-party payer perspective (compulsory social insurance), between patients treated at individual practices (IP) and at MHs. We compare the sociodemographic profile of MH and IP users. Research Design: This is a retrospective study using public insurance claims data. Generalized linear models estimate the impact on health expenditures of being treated at a MH versus IP, controlling for individual, and area-based sociodemographic characteristics. The choice of primary care setting is modeled using logistic regressions. Subjects: A random sample of 43,678 persons followed during the year 2004. Measures: Third-party payer expenditures for primary care, secondary care consultations, pharmaceuticals, laboratory tests, acute and long-term inpatient care. Results: Overall third-party payer expenditures do not differ significantly between MH and IP users ((sic)+27). Third-party payer primary care expenditures are higher for MH than for IP users ((sic)+129), but this difference is offset by lower expenditures for secondary care consultations ((sic)-11), drugs ((sic)-40), laboratory tests ((sic)-5) and acute and long-term inpatient care ((sic)-53). MHs attract younger and more underprivileged populations. Conclusions: MHs induce a shift in expenditures from secondary care, drugs, and laboratory tests to primary care, while treating a less economically favored population. Combined with positive results regarding quality, MH structures are a promising way to tackle the challenges of primary care.', \"Background To improve mental health care access, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) implemented Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) in clinics nationally. Primary care clinical leader satisfaction can inform model implementation and may be facilitated by collaborative care managers and technology supporting cross-specialty collaboration. Objective (1) To determine primary care clinical leaders' overall satisfaction with care from embedded mental health providers for a range of conditions and (2) to examine the association between overall satisfaction and two program features (care managers, technology). Design Cross-sectional organizational survey in one VA region (Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico), 2018. Participants Sixty-nine physicians or other designated clinical leaders in each VA primary care clinic (94% response rate). Main Measures We assessed primary care clinical leader satisfaction with embedded mental health care on four groups of conditions: target, non-target mental health, behavioral health, suicide risk management. They additionally responded about the availability of mental health care managers and the sufficiency of information technology (telemental health, e-consult, instant messaging). We examined relationships between satisfaction and the two program features using chi(2)tests and multivariable regressions. Key Results Most primary care clinical leaders were very satisfied with care for targeted anxiety (71%) and depression (69%), but not for other common conditions (37% alcohol misuse, 19% pain). Care manager availability was significantly associated with very satisfied responses for depression (p = .02) and anxiety care by embedded mental health providers (p = .02). Highly rated sufficiency of communication technology (only 19%) was associated with very satisfied responses to suicide risk management (p = .002). Conclusions Care from embedded mental health providers for depression and anxiety was highly satisfactory, which may guide improvement among less satisfactory conditions (alcohol misuse, pain). Observed associations between overall satisfaction and collaborative care features may inform clinics on how to optimize staffing and technology based on priority conditions.\", 'Background: Immigrants make up one fifth of the Canadian population and this number continues to grow. Adequate access to primary health care is important for this population but it is not clear if this is being achieved. This study explored patient reported access to primary health care of a population of immigrants in Ontario, Canada who were users of the primary care system and compared this with Canadian-born individuals; and by model of primary care practice. Methods: This study uses data from the Comparison of Models of Primary Care Study (COMP-PC), a mixed-methods, practice-based, cross-sectional study that collected information from patients and providers in 137 primary care practices across Ontario, Canada in 2005-2006. The practices were randomly sampled to ensure an equal number of practices in each of the four dominant primary care models at that time: Fee-For-Service, Community Health Centres, and the two main capitation models (Health Service Organization and Family Health Networks). Adult patients of participating practices were identified when they presented for an appointment and completed a survey in the waiting room. Three measures of access were used, all derived from the patient survey: First Contact Access, First Contact Utilization (both based on the Primary Care Assessment Tool) and number of self-reported visits to the practice in the past year. Results: Of the 5,269 patients who reported country of birth 1,099 (20.8%) were born outside of Canada. In adjusted analysis, recent immigrants (arrival in Canada within the past five years) and immigrants in Canada for more than 20 years were less likely to report good health compared to Canadian-born (Odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.36,0.92 and 0.81, 95% CI 0.67,0.99). Overall, immigrants reported equal access to primary care services compared with Canadian-born. Within immigrant groups recently arrived immigrants had similar access scores to Canadian-born but reported 5.3 more primary care visits after adjusting for health status. Looking across models, recent immigrants in Fee-For-Service practices reported poorer access and fewer primary care visits compared to Canadian-born. Conclusions: Overall, immigrants who were users of the primary care system reported a similar level of access as Canadian-born individuals. While recent immigrants are in poorer health compared with Canadian-born they report adequate access to primary care. The differences in access for recently arrived immigrants, across primary care models suggests that organizational features of primary care may lead to inequity in access.', 'BackgroundHealthcare coordination and continuity of care conceptualize all care providers and organizations involved in health care to ensure the right care at the right time. However, systematic evidence synthesis is lacking in the care coordination of health services. This scoping review synthesizes evidence on different levels of care coordination of primary health care (PHC) and primary care.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of published evidence on healthcare coordination. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched until 30 November 2022 for studies that describe care coordination/continuity of care in PHC and primary care. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to select studies. We analysed data using a thematic analysis approach and explained themes adopting a multilevel (individual, organizational, and system) analytical framework.ResultsA total of 56 studies were included in the review. Most studies were from upper-middle-income or high-income countries, primarily focusing on continuity/care coordination in primary care. Ten themes were identified in care coordination in PHC/primary care. Four themes under care coordination at the individual level were the continuity of services, linkage at different stages of health conditions (from health promotion to rehabilitation), health care from a life-course (conception to elderly), and care coordination of health services at places (family to hospitals). Five themes under organizational level care coordination included interprofessional, multidisciplinary services, community collaboration, integrated care, and information in care coordination. Finally, a theme under system-level care coordination was related to service management involving multisectoral coordination within and beyond health systems.ConclusionsContinuity and coordination of care involve healthcare provisions from family to health facility throughout the life-course to provide a range of services. Several issues could influence multilevel care coordination, including at the individual (services or users), organizational (providers), and system (departments and sectors) levels. Health systems should focus on care coordination, ensuring types of care per the healthcare needs at different stages of health conditions by a multidisciplinary team. Coordinating multiple technical and supporting stakeholders and sectors within and beyond health sector is also vital for the continuity of care especially in resource-limited health systems and settings.', \"Background: In 2010, a national integrated health care standard for (childhood) obesity was published and disseminated in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the needs of health care providers and the barriers they face in terms of implementing this integrated health care standard. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was applied using focus groups, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and an e-mail-based internet survey. The study's participants included: general practitioners (GPs) (focus groups); health care providers in different professions (face-to-face interviews) and health care providers, including GPs; youth health care workers; pediatricians; dieticians; psychologists and physiotherapists (survey). First, the transcripts from the focus groups were analyzed thematically. The themes identified in this process were then used to analyze the interviews. The results of the analysis of the qualitative data were used to construct the statements used in the e-mail-based internet survey. Responses to items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale and were categorized into three outcomes: 'agree' or 'important' (response categories 1 and 2), 'disagree' or 'not important'. Results: Twenty-seven of the GPs that were invited (51 %) participated in four focus groups. Seven of the nine health care professionals that were invited (78 %) participated in the interviews and 222 questionnaires (17 %) were returned and included in the analysis. The following key barriers were identified with regard to the implementation of the integrated health care standard: reluctance to raise the subject; perceived lack of motivation and knowledge on the part of the parents; previous negative experiences with lifestyle programs; financial constraints and the lack of a structured multidisciplinary approach. The main needs identified were: increased knowledge and awareness on the part of both health care providers and parents/children; a social map of effective intervention; structural funding; task rearrangements; a central care coordinator and structural information feedback from the health care providers involved. Conclusions: The integrated health care standard stipulate that the care of overweight or obese children be provided using an integrated approach. The barriers and needs identified in this study can be used to define strategies to improve the implementation of the integrated health care standard pertaining to overweight and obese children in the Netherlands.\", 'Background Due to gender inequities that exist for women of childbearing age, there exists a need to deliver care tailored to their needs and preferences. Patient-centred care (PCC) can be used to meet these needs. This review aims to compare patient care delivery between PCC and obstetrical care. This can help us address how PCC should be delivered to women before, during and after pregnancy versus how it is delivered to patients regardless of sex. Methods A review of literature was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for English PCC and high-quality perinatal reviews published between 2010 and 2021. The data were analysed using a modified Walker and Avant framework. Results A total of 2138 unique studies were identified, with 11 PCC and 9 high-quality obstetrical care studies included. Common defining features between PCC and obstetrical care include respect and dignity, informed decision-making, therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. PCC-specific features were holistic care, empowerment, individualized care, coordinated care and empathy. Unique high-quality obstetrical care themes included continuity of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education and status, physical environment and equitable maternal care. Conclusions There are shared defining attributes between PCC and obstetrical care, including respect and dignity, informed decision-making, the therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. However, there remain unique defining attributes for high-quality obstetrical care and PCC. This highlights the need for a unique approach to obstetrical care. More research on care for different physiological conditions in women is needed to address patient care that addresses different parts of the lifespan and develop frameworks that can influence health policy, patient care and health system evaluation. Patient or Public Contribution This study was one part of a larger, multicomponent study of how to implement PCC for women across the lifespan. While we did not specifically consult or involve women in this dual concept analysis, our larger study (content analysis of clinical guidelines and government policies, qualitative interviews with women and clinicians, Delphi study to prioritize consensus recommendations for achieving PCC for women) was guided by the experiences and input of a 50+ women advisory panel.', \"Policy Points A consensus regarding the need to orient health systems to address inequities is emerging, with much of this discussion targeting population health interventions and indicators. We know less about applying these approaches to primary health care. This study empirically demonstrates that providing more equity-oriented health care (EOHC) in primary health care, including trauma- and violence-informed, culturally safe, and contextually tailored care, predicts improved health outcomes across time for people living in marginalizing conditions. This is achieved by enhancing patients' comfort and confidence in their care and their own confidence in preventing and managing health problems. This promising new evidence suggests that equity-oriented interventions at the point of care can begin to shift inequities in health outcomes for those with the greatest need. Context Significant attention has been directed toward addressing health inequities at the population health and systems levels, yet little progress has been made in identifying approaches to reduce health inequities through clinical care, particularly in a primary health care context. Although the provision of equity-oriented health care (EOHC) is widely assumed to lead to improvements in patients' health outcomes, little empirical evidence supports this claim. To remedy this, we tested whether more EOHC predicts more positive patient health outcomes and identified selected mediators of this relationship. Methods Our analysis uses longitudinal data from 395 patients recruited from 4 primary health care clinics serving people living in marginalizing conditions. The participants completed 4 structured interviews composed of self-report measures and survey questions over a 2-year period. Using path analysis techniques, we tested a hypothesized model of the process through which patients' perceptions of EOHC led to improvements in self-reported health outcomes (quality of life, chronic pain disability, and posttraumatic stress [PTSD] and depressive symptoms), including particular covariates of health outcomes (age, gender, financial strain, experiences of discrimination). Findings Over a 24-month period, higher levels of EOHC predicted greater patient comfort and confidence in the health care patients received, leading to increased confidence to prevent and manage their health problems, which, in turn, improved health outcomes (depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, and quality of life). In addition, financial strain and experiences of discrimination had significant negative effects on all health outcomes. Conclusions This study is among the first to demonstrate empirically that providing more EOHC predicts better patient health outcomes over time. At a policy level, this research supports investments in equity-focused organizational and provider-level processes in primary health care as a means of improving patients' health, particularly for those living in marginalizing conditions. Whether these results are robust in different patient groups and across a broader range of health care contexts requires further study.\", 'Introduction: The study objectives are to describe the national health and safety standards in family child care homes (FCCHs) and child care centers and compare them by child care type. Method: Child care health consultants and research assistants completed the standardized Health and Safety Checklist, which comprised key national health and safety standards, in a convenience sample of 21 FCCHs and 31 child care centers enrolled in two larger studies conducted in CA. Results: The checklist was completed in 1 or 2 hours in FCCHs and centers, respectively. The internal consistency of the overall checklist subscales was moderate to strong. Eight of 10 checklist subscales were not significantly different in FCCHs and centers, but outdoor facilities (p < .05) and supervision, interaction, and physical activity (p < .05) were different. Discussion: The Health and Safety Checklist is valid in FCCHs and centers and identifies targeted interventions for nurses to improve child care quality.', 'Background: Use of telemental health has increased among rural Medicare beneficiaries, particularly among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Little is known about what leads to the initiation of telemental health. Objective: To categorize the different patterns of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health services among individuals with SMI. Methods: A cohort of rural beneficiaries with SMI (defined as schizophrenia/related psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder) with an index telemental health visit in 2010-2017 was built using claims for a 20% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The authors used latent class analysis to identify classes of mental health care use in the 6 months before the index telemental health visits. Across the classes, the authors also described characteristics of index and subsequent mental health visits. Results: The cohort included 4930 rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Three classes of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health were identified. The largest class (n=3066) had minimal use of primary care provider mental health care and the second largest class (n=1537) had minimal specialty mental health care. The smallest class (n=327) was characterized by recent hospitalization or emergency department care. In the overall cohort, index visits were frequently established visits and were often with specialty prescribers. Conclusions: Our findings highlight 3 distinct patterns of care before telemental health initiation, providing insight into the role that telemedicine may play in mental health care for rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Overall, telemental health was most often used to maintain care with existing providers.', \"Purpose: Youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) increasingly live into adulthood, and approximately 500,000 U.S. youth transition from pediatric to adult health care systems annually. Through a systematic literature review, we sought to (1) determine adult outcomes for YSHCN who have no special transition interventions and (2) identify evidence for strategies that lead to better outcomes, in particular, access to adult health care. Methods: We searched the medical, nursing, psychology, and social science literature and reviewed selected articles' reference lists. Transition experts also recommended relevant articles. Search criteria included health conditions, transition-related activities, and health care and related outcomes. We selected English-language articles published from 1986 to 2010, with an abstract, description of transition-related interventions (objective 2), and posttransition outcomes. Investigators abstracted study design, population, sample size, description of intervention, data collection methods, and findings. Results: The search yielded 3,370 articles, of which 15 met study criteria. Although many YSHCN appear to make the transition to adult health providers successfully, some experience serious gaps in outcomes; those with more complex conditions or with conditions affecting the nervous system appear to have less good transitions. Some evidence supports introducing YSHCN to adult providers before leaving the pediatric system; one study supports using care coordinators to improve outcomes. Conclusions: Evidence regarding programs to facilitate transition for YSHCN is inconclusive. Weak evidence suggests that meeting adult providers before transfer may facilitate posttransition access to care. We recommend additional studies with strong research designs to guide best practice in preparing YSHCN for adulthood. (c) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Despite these efforts, many Americans do not have access to basic medical care. This study was designed to identify barriers faced by low-income parents when accessing health care for their children and how insurance status affects their reporting of these barriers. METHODS A mixed methods analysis was undertaken using 722 responses to an open-ended question on a health care access survey instrument that asked low-income Oregon families, Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Themes were identified using immersion/crystallization techniques. Pertinent demographic attributes were used to conduct matrix coded queries. RESULTS Families reported 3 major barriers: lack of insurance coverage, poor access to services, and unafforclable costs. Disproportionate reporting of these themes was most notable based on insurance status. A higher percentage of uninsured parents (87%) reported experiencing difficulties obtaining insurance coverage compared with 40% of those with insurance. Few of the uninsured expreswsed concerns about access to services or health access to services or health care costs (19%). Access concerns were the most common among publicly insured families, and costs were more often mentioned by families with private insurance. Families made a clear distinction between insurance and access, and having one or both elements did not assure Care. Our analyses-income families. uncovered a 3-part typology of barriers to health care for low-income families. CONCLUSIONS Barriers to health care can be insurmountable for low-income families, even those with insurance coverage. Patients who do not seek care in a family medicine clinic are not necessarily getting their care elsewhere.', 'Purpose: To examine health care spending patterns for U.S. adolescents aged 10 to 18 years using nationally representative household survey data. Methods: We analyzed data from the 1997 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey on total expenditures and out-of-pocket expenditures for health care based on a sample of 4882 adolescents. Results: Compared with that for adults, health care expenditures for adolescents were low, averaging $799 per adolescent in 1997. Disabled and functionally impaired adolescents had disproportionately high expenditures ($1960 per capita). Blacks and adolescents living in poor families had disproportionately low expenditures ($358 and $609 per capita, respectively). Professional services provided by physicians and dentists accounted for more than one-half of all health care spending for adolescents. Only 2% of adolescents were hospitalized in 1997, but they accounted for about one-fifth of all health care expenditures. The share of health expenditures paid out of pocket varied by type of service, ranging from 3% for inpatient hospital care to 51% for dental care. When covered, insurance provided substantial financial protection for families of adolescents: those with public coverage paid 8%, those with private coverage paid 32%, and those without coverage paid 61% of their health care bills out of pocket. The share of health care bills paid out of pocket would be much lower if dental care was excluded. Conclusions: On the basis of our findings that health care expenditures for adolescents are low and that insurance coverage provides critically needed financial protection, we conclude that further expansions of public and private health insurance coverage for this population would provide significant benefits at modest additional cost. Additional efforts to improve coverage of services that are not now well-covered, such as dental care, would also be valuable. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2003.', 'Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the extent of ultrasound availability in Norwegian casualty clinics and estimate the prevalence of its use. Design: A retrospective study based on a national casualty clinic registry and data from reimbursement claims. Setting: Out-of-hours primary health care in Norway. Subjects: All Norwegian casualty clinics in 2016 and reimbursement claims from 2008 to 2015. Main outcome measures: Percent of casualty clinics with ultrasound, types of ultrasound devices and probes, reasons for/against ultrasound access, characteristics of clinics with/without ultrasound, frequency of five ultrasound indications and characteristics of the physicians using/not using ultrasound. Results: Out of 182 casualty clinics, 41 (23%) reported access to ultrasound. Mobile (49%) and stationary (44%) devices were most frequent. Physician request was the most common cited reason for ultrasound access (66%). Neither population served by the casualty clinic nor distance to hospital showed any clear association with ultrasound access. All of the five ultrasound reimbursement codes showed a substantial increase from 2008 to 2015 with 14.1 ultrasound examinations being performed per 10,000 consultations in 2015. Only 6.5% of physicians performed ultrasound in 2015 and males were significantly more likely to use ultrasound than females (OR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.38-2.47, p<.001), even when adjusted for age, speciality status and geography. Conclusions: Although the use of ultrasound is increasing in out-of-hours Norwegian primary health care, most casualty clinics do not have access and only a minority of physicians use ultrasound.', \"The use of information and communication technologies in health and health care could improve healthcare quality in many ways. Today's evidence base demonstrates the (cost-)effectiveness of online education, self-management support and tele-monitoring in several domains of health and care. While new results gradually provide more evidence for eHealth's impact on quality issues, now is the time to come to grips with implementation issues. Documented drawbacks such as low acceptance, low adoption or low adherence need our attention today to make the most of eHealth' potential. Improvement science is beginning to deliver the tools to address these persistent behavioural and cultural issues. The ceHRes Roadmap, for instance, is a plural and pragmatic approach that includes users' needs. It is now imperative to improve our implementation strategies in order to scale up eHealth technologies. This will accelerate the much needed transformation of our healthcare systems and sustain access, affordability and quality for all in the near future.\", \"Work disability creates significant expenses for nations and causes human suffering by limiting patients' lives. International studies show that to enhance recognition of and support for work disability, cooperation, mutual trust, and information exchange between public primary health care and occupational health care must be strengthened. However, little is known of how health care professionals experience this cooperation. The aim of this study was to understand how professionals experience the cooperation between public primary health care and occupational health services regarding patients' work ability. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 health care professionals working in five small cities (<10,000 inhabitants) in Finland. Interviews were audio and video recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Three key themes were identified from the interviews: attitudes toward the other health care sector, the exchange of information, and resources for cooperation. Professionals seem to have poor knowledge about the services available and how care is given in the other sector, appearing to lead to weak mutual trust. The public primary health care professionals especially emphasized the benefits of cooperation, but several issues were mentioned as barriers to cooperation. These results can be used when planning effective patient paths and service provisioning models.\", \"During the last decade there has been considerable international mobilisation around shrinking the role of States in health care. The World Bank reports that, in many low and middle-income countries, private sources of finance comprise the largest share of total national health expenditures. Private sector health care is ubiquitous, reaches throughout the population, preferred by the people and is significant from both economic as well as health perspective. Resources are limited, governments are weak, and a new approach is needed. This paper provides a broad overview and raises key issues with regard to private health care. The focus is on provision of health care by private medical providers. On the background of the world's common health problems and interventions available to tackle them, the place of private health care in the overall context is first discussed. The concept of privatisation within the various forms of health care systems is then explained. The paper then describes the genesis and key elements of rapidly enhancing role of the private sector in health care and points to the paucity of literature from low and middle-income countries. Common concerns about private health care are outlined. Two illustrative examples - tuberculosis, the top infectious killer among the poor and coronary heart disease, the top noninfectious killer among the I ich - are presented to understand the current and possible role of private sector in provision of health care. Highlighting the need to distinguish between health care as a public good or a market commodity, the paper leaves it to the reader to draw conclusions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Primary care physicians (PCP) are filling expanded roles within oral health care to secure strong overall health for their patients. Methods: This comparative case study examines the roles of PCPs at 5 federally qualified health centers that have integrated oral health care and primary care. Administrative data were obtained directly from the Health Resources and Services Administration. Key informant interviews were performed with administrators and clinical care team members at each of the health centers. Data were reviewed by 2 experts in oral health to identify emerging roles for physicians. Results: PPCPs' roles in health centers' integration models vary, but 3 distinct roles emerged: (1) the physician as a champion, (2) the physician as a collaborator, and (3) the physician as a member of an interprofessional team. In addition, providing physicians with the necessary training to identify oral health issues was critical to preparing physicians to take on expanded roles in integrated health care delivery models. Conclusions: Regardless of the roles that they play, family physicians can contribute a great deal to the success of integration models.\", 'Aim: The major objectives of this study were to evaluate the existing pediatrics health care service provisions and utilizations of the public polyclinics in Barbados. Furthermore, the aim was to assess if the existing manpower resources were adequate. Background: Barbados has a mixed health care system consisting of both a socialized and a private health care system. The Ministry of Health commissioned a needs assessment survey of the pediatrics primary health care at the public polyclinics. Methods: Primary data were collected through interviews with the public primary health care providers. Secondary data were collected from the Barbados Census Data and Ministry of Health statistics. Data were analyzed to assess the pediatrics primary health care service utilization and adequacy of existing resources at the polyclinics. Findings: In 2012, there were 62 934 visits from children < 16 years of age to the public polyclinics in Barbados and this accounted for 39.1% of all visits (both adults and children) to the polyclinics. An overall 16.7% of the visits were from children less than five years old to the Well Child Clinic for immunization and for growth and development monitoring; 32% of all physician consultations at the polyclinics were for children < 16 years. Utilization of health services by children at the polyclinics was 5245 visits/month. Given an expected monthly demand for 10 822 visits from children, the polyclinics serve 48.5% of the primary health care demand for children in Barbados. Conclusions: The public polyclinics play a pivotal role in the pluralistic primary health care system in Barbados. They fulfill nearly half of all the primary care demand and more importantly provides for almost the entire immunization demand, and thereby ensuring high coverage. The existing resources, if used optimally, would reduce the long consultation time observed in this setting, and thereby increase the capacity considerably.', \"A visit to the dental clinic may be challenging for a child with Down syndrome due to medical and oral health problems as well as communication problems. The aim of the present study was to explore how parents of children with Down syndrome describe their child's needs in the dental health care setting. In a survey concerning parental experiences with dental health care in Sweden, free comments were analysed with content analysis and resulted in five categories: Need for continuity of care in dental health care; Need for dental health care professionals to have knowledge and expertise in caring for children with Down syndrome and other disabilities; Need for dental health care professionals to use a caring approach with children with Down syndrome; Need for the child with Down syndrome to be prepared to participate in their dental health care visit and Need for the child with Down syndrome to be given the same rights as typically developing children. To support children with Down syndrome in an optimal way, dental health care needs to be tailored to meet the child's unique needs. In addition, dental health care professionals need knowledge of and expertise in the care of children with Down syndrome.\", \"Objective To examine health status and health care experiences of homeless patients in health centers and to compare them with their nonhomeless counterparts. Data Sources/Study Setting Nationally representative data from the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey. Study Design Cross-sectional analyses were limited to adults (n=2,683). We compared sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, access to health care, and utilization of services among homeless and nonhomeless patients. We also examined the independent effect of homelessness on health care access and utilization, as well as factors that influenced homeless patients' health care experiences. Data Collection Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted with health center patients. Principal Findings Homeless patients had worse health statuslifetime burden of chronic conditions, mental health problems, and substance use problemscompared with housed respondents. In adjusted analyses, homeless patients had twice the odds as housed patients of having unmet medical care needs in the past year (OR=1.98, 95 percent CI: 1.243.16) and twice the odds of having an ED visit in the past year (OR=2.00, 95 percent CI: 1.372.92). Conclusions There is an ongoing need to focus on the health issues that disproportionately affect homeless populations. Among health center patients, homelessness is an independent risk factor for unmet medical needs and ED use.\", \"Background: Easy access to palliative care is one of the basic needs of cancer patients, and this can be achieved by providing such services at the community level. One approach to provide community-based palliative care is to integrate it with primary health care (PHC). Considering the antiquity and extension of the PHC system in Iran and the importance of being aware of stakeholders' views in order to integrate a palliative care provision model into a country's health care system, we aimed to explain health care providers' perception of the integration of palliative care with PHC. Methods: The present qualitative research was conducted using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from October 2016 to July 2020. The participants of the study included the stakeholders involved in providing palliative care to cancer patients, as well as PHC system experts. The participants were selected purposefully using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected through holding 21 semi-structured interviews and one focused group session and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results: Qualitative data analysis revealed three main categories and ten subcategories. The main categories included the health system's structure as an opportunity (with the subcategories of employing the network system for providing health services, establishment of a referral system, and establishment of the family physician program and manpower diversity), requirements (with the subcategories of the position of home care centers and their relationship with PHC, opioid use management, equipment management, financial support, and legal issues), and outcomes (with the subcategories of facilitated access to services and good death). Conclusion: Iran's health system possesses adequate infrastructure for providing palliative care to cancer patients within the context of PHC. Beside available opportunities, there are also problems that need to be resolved so that families can meet their patients' care needs and provide them with an easy death by having access to home-based palliative care.\", 'Aim: Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) are primary care clinics certified through Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to the medically underserved in rural areas of the United States. The purpose of this paper is to describe how the characteristics of RHCs have either changed or remained stable over a 10-year period in the past: from the late 1990s to 2007. In addition, it is also to describe some of the outstanding needs of RHCs as they navigate the transitions of U.S. health care reform. Methods: Using a panel of RHCs continuously in existence from 2006 through 2007, we calculated and compared statistics with corresponding statistics from the literature. We described the geographic distribution of RHCs, demographics of their counties of location, and characteristics of RHC structure and staffing. We also explored the implications of the recently enacted health reform law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) for RHCs, and the improvements that RHCs need as it is implemented. Findings: By the end of the study period, the highest percentages of RHCs were in the South and Midwest, the percentage of RHCs in the West had grown, and that in the South had declined. RHCs served counties with increasing proportions of individuals below poverty and Hispanics/Latinos. The percentage of independent clinics had grown, as had the percentage of for-profit clinics. Finally, the percentage of nurse practitioner full-time equivalents had grown as a proportion of the total for three providers. Conclusions: In investigating the performance of RHCs, many managerial and operational factors are not well understood. It is imperative that RHCs gather the information that could help them maximize the elements of their performance that would keep them financially stable. In addition, a broader awareness of the unique challenges that RHCs face in this era of health care reform is needed.', 'Introduction: Many families enroll their infants and toddlers in early education and child care programs. The Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics recruited 32 child care centers that care for infants and toddlers to be linked with a child care health consultant (CCHC). Method: Project staff assigned the centers alternately to an immediate intervention or a 1-year delayed intervention (contrast) group. At entry into the project, and then 1 and 2 years later, an evaluator assessed center compliance with 13 standards for infants and toddler care selected from Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards (3rd ed.). Project staff linked the Immediate Intervention centers with a CCHC in Year 1. In Year 2, in a crossover comparison, project staff linked Contrast centers with a CCHC. Results: Working with a CCHC effectively improved compliance with some selected health and safety standards.', 'Background: Patients with obesity are at risk for treatment avoidance and nonadherence. Factors that contribute to engagement in primary health care for patients with obesity are not fully understood. Aim: The purpose of this pilot study was to identify issues associated with engagement in primary health care for patients with obesity. Method: Using qualitativemethodology, 11 patients with a mean body mass index of 40.8 kg/m(2) registered with a primary health care practice were interviewed. Conventional content analysis was used to identify factors that contribute to engagement in primary health care. Results: Barriers and facilitators to engagement in primary health care were categorized into the following themes: availability of resources, importance of the relationship, meaningful communication, feeling judged, lack of privacy, poor communication and limited provider knowledge about obesity. Conclusion: Obesity was identified as a health condition that requires additional considerations for patient engagement in their health care.', 'This paper discusses the role of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) in identifying and solving problems within the health care industry. It reviews current AHCPR activities and details the results of the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey, the recent poll of how people in the United States make choices about health care. A discussion of present quality measurement tools, such as CONQUEST, a database of existing performance measures, includes an outline of plans for developing new measures of quality and outcomes. Also explored are ideas for improving quality measurements, potential problems and risks, and the public role in health services research.', 'Background: After an organizational transformation in the mid-1990s, the quality of care in the Veterans Affairs health-care system (VA) compared favorably with the quality of care in some private-sector settings. Whether this performance advantage has persisted, and also its relation to geographic and socioeconomic variations in care, is unknown. Objective: We compared the quality and equity of care for older adults in the VA with that delivered in Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans using the same performance measures. Research Design: Cross-sectional comparison. Subjects: A total of 293,554 observations from enrollees in 142 VA medical centers (VAMCs) and 5,768,573 observations from enrollees in 305 MA plans. Measurements: Adherence to quality measures assessing diabetes, cardiovascular, and cancer screening care from 2000 to 2007. Results: The VA outperformed MA plans on 10 of 11 quality measures in the initial study year, and on all 12 measures in the final year. In 2006 and 2007, adjusted differences between the VA and MA ranged from 4.3 percentage points (95% CI, 3.2-5.4) for cholesterol testing in coronary heart disease to 30.8 percentage points (95% CI, 28.1-33.5) for colorectal cancer screening. For 9 of 12 measures, socioeconomic disparities (defined as the difference in performance rates between persons in the highest and lowest quartiles of area-level income and education) were lower in the VA than in MA. Across all measures, the mean interquartile range of performance was 6.7 percentage points for VAMCs and 14.5 percentage points for MA plans. Conclusions: Among persons aged 65 years or older, the VA health-care system significantly outperformed private-sector MA plans and delivered care that was less variable by site, geographic region, and socioeconomic status.', 'Background: In Hungary, since 1990, each government has tried to transform and rationalize the structure of health care. One of the reforms was the Care Managing Organization (CMO) programme introduced in 1999. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to describe the regional, environmental, structural and preliminary health related outcomes of the CMO in Bacs-Kiskun County (Central-Eastern Hungary). Methods: First, cardiovascular screening programmes were organized for pre-screened and randomly selected populations of a total of 4462 persons. Seven years after completing the programmes, regional mortality data were analysed and compared. Second, nutritional and lifestyle counselling programmes with increased physical activity were organized for 2489 overweight or obese patients from the participating primary care practices. Anthropometric and laboratory data were examined after one and two years. Results: First, for persons with higher cardiovascular risk, appropriate medical treatment was introduced, and after seven years, their mortality rates proved better than the regional and national data. Second, almost all measured anthropometric parameters improved (body mass index, body weight decrease) after the first year and this trend lasted till the end of the second year. Conclusions: According to the data of the National Health Insurance Fund, the average savings rate for all CMOs for the fiscal years 1999-2007 was 4.94%. The highest rates of savings were realized in chronic and acute inpatient care and medical devices. In the end of 2008, by which time 14 CMOs had already covered 2.1 million people, the programme was discontinued by the government, without a comprehensive evaluation of the experience and outcomes.', 'This article analyzes Dutch experiences of health care reform-in particular in primary care-with emphasis on lessons for current United States health care reforms. Recent major innovations were the introduction of private insurance based on the principles of primary care-led health care and including all citizens irrespective of their financial, employment, or health status; introduction of primary care collaboratives for out-of-hour services and chronic disease management; and primary care team building, including practice nurses. These innovations were introduced on top of a strong primary care tradition of family practices with defined populations based on patient panels, practice-based research, evidence-based medicine, large-scale computerization, and strong primary care health informatics. Dutch health reform redirected payment to support introduction of innovative health plans and strengthening of primary care to respond to public health objectives. Five recommendations for US primary care follow from this Dutch experience: (1) a private insurance model is compatible with thriving primary care, but it must include all people, especially the most vulnerable in society, and espouse a primary care-led health care system; (2) patient panels or practice lists strengthen continuity of care and community orientation to focus on and respond to local needs; (3) reward collaboration within primary care and between primary care, hospital care, and public health; (4) stimulate primary care professionals to exert their passion and expertise through participation in primary care research and development; and (5) health informatics should be primary care based, preferably adopting the International Classification of Primary Care. With these recommendations, it will be possible for the United States to obtain better population health for its population. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012;25:S12-17.)', 'Background: While religious involvement is associated with improvements in health, little is known about the relationship between church participation and health care practices. Objectives: To determine 1) the prevalence of church participation; 2) whether church participation influences positive health care practices; and 3) whether gender, age, insurance status, and levels of comorbidity modified these relationships. Design: A cross-sectional analysis using survey data from 2196 residents of a low-income, African-American neighborhood. Measurements: Our independent variable measured the frequency of church attendance. Dependent variables were: 1) Pap smear; 2) mammogram; and 3) dental visit-all taking place within 2 years; 4) blood pressure measurement within 1 year, 5) having a regular source of care, and 6) no perceived delays in care in the previous year. We controlled for socioeconomic factors and the number of comorbid conditions and also tested for interactions. Results: Thirty-seven percent of community members went to church at least monthly. Church attendance was associated with increased likelihood of positive health care practices by 20% to 80%. In multivariate analyses, church attendance was related to dental visits (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 1.9) and blood pressure measurements (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1). Insurance status and number of comorbid conditions modified the relationship between church attendance and Pap smear, with increased practices noted for the uninsured (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.1) and for women with 2 or more comorbid conditions (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5). Conclusion: Church attendance is an important correlate of positive health care practices, especially for the most vulnerable subgroups, the uninsured and chronically ill. Community- and faith-based organizations present additional opportunities to improve the health of low-income and minority populations.', \"Although many health care reforms have been enacted in the last few years in Germany, many of the key points in the current social health care system have been retained from former times. All those introductions for an effective health care system from the last 150 years beginning with mandatory guild membership via Bismarck's social laws to the modern health care systems in Germany with the current problems of financing the heavy burden in the German budget are reported. Data and facts on the current health care system are provided. In the following two articles of this series ambulatory and inpatient treatment in the light of economic aspects of health care are reported.\", 'We examined racial/ethnic disparities in unmet specialty, dental, mental, and allied health care needs among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) using data on 38,866 children in the National Survey of CSHCN. Compared with White CSHCN, Black CSHCN had significantly greater unmet specialty (9.6% vs. 6.7%), dental (16% vs. 8.7%), and mental (27% vs. 17%) health care needs. Hispanic CSHCN had greater unmet dental care needs (15.8% vs. 8.7%). Black females had greater unmet mental health care needs than other groups (41% vs. 13-20%). Most disparities disappeared after multivariate adjustment. Significant risk factors for unmet health care needs included uninsurance, having no personal doctor/nurse, poverty, and condition stability and severity. Eliminating unmet specialty, dental, and mental health care needs for all CSHCN, and especially minority CSHCN, may require greater efforts to reduce poverty and increase insurance coverage among CSHCN, better mental health care assessment of Black female CSHCN, and ensuring all CSHCN have a medical home.', \"This study intends to map the health care given to the usuary with needs in the mental health field in a primary health care unity, analyzing the team work in the light of the integrate primary health care practices. The participants are health workers from different professions, who belong to the service's mental health working processes. The data collection technique used was the analytic flowchart. The results show us that the connective flows among the professionals and between them and the health unity's, in the primary health care unit, has been producing and proliferated diverse exchanges' spaces, making possible health actions aligned to the integrality in people's care through a enlarged understanding of health mental disease process, by means of human relationships' valuation and subjectivities involved in the health work space.\", \"Purpose: To examine unmet health needs and health care utilization among youth with special health care needs (YSHCN). Methods: We analyzed data among youth aged 12-17 years using the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. We conducted descriptive analyses comparing YSHCN with non-YSHCN, and bivariate and multivariable analyses examining associations between dependent and independent measures. Six dependent variables represented unmet needs and utilization. Adjusted analyses controlled for sociodemographic and health measures. Results: A total of 5,862 individuals were identified as YSHCN, and nearly 70% had three or more comorbid conditions. Over 90% used medical care, preventive care, or dental care in the past 12 months, while 8% reported having unmet health needs (compared with 2.8% of non-YSHCN). Using a typology of qualifying criteria for special health care needs, we found that YSHCN with increasing complexity of needs were more likely to report unmet health needs, use of mental health care services, and emergency department use, compared with YSHCN using medication only to manage their conditions. All YSHCN living in households below 400% federal poverty level were less likely to utilize nearly all types of health care examined, with the exception of mental health care use, compared with those at or above 400% federal poverty level. Conclusions: Differences in complexity of needs, race/ethnicity, and poverty status highlight existing gaps in health care utilization and persistent unmet health needs among YSHCN. Efforts should focus on strengthening coordinated systems of care that optimally meet the needs of YSHCN so they may thrive in their families and communities.

Objective: To describe the reproductive health diagnoses of women Veterans using VA health care, how these diagnoses differ across age groups, and variations in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics by presence of reproductive health diagnoses. Research Design: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of VA administrative and clinical data. Subjects: The study included women Veterans using VA health care in FY10. Measures: Reproductive health diagnoses were identified through presence of International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes in VA clinical and administrative records. The prevalence of specific diagnosis categories were examined by age group (18-44, 45-64, >= 65 y) and the most frequent diagnoses for each age group were identified. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared by presence of at least 1 reproductive health diagnosis. Results: The most frequent reproductive health diagnoses were menstrual disorders and endometriosis among those aged 18-44 years (n = 16,658, 13%), menopausal disorders among those aged 45-64 years (n = 20,707, 15%), and osteoporosis among those aged >= 65 years (n = 8365, 22%). Compared with women without reproductive health diagnoses, those with such diagnoses were more likely to have concomitant mental health (46% vs. 37%, P < 0.001) and medical conditions (75% vs. 63%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Women Veterans using VA health care have diverse reproductive health diagnoses. The high prevalence of comorbid medical and mental health conditions among women Veterans with reproductive health diagnoses highlights the importance of integrating reproductive health expertise into all areas of VA health care, including primary, mental health, and specialty care.', 'Objectives:Identifying routinely recorded markers of poor health in patients with dementia may help treatment decisions and evaluation of earlier outcomes in research. Our objective was to determine whether a set of credible markers of dementia-related health could be identified from primary care electronic health records (EHR). Methods:The study consisted of (i) rapid review of potential measures of dementia-related health used in EHR studies; (ii) consensus exercise to assess feasibility of identifying these markers in UK primary care EHR; (iii) development of UK EHR code lists for markers; (iv) analysis of a regional primary care EHR database to determine further potential markers; (v) consensus exercise to finalise markers and pool into higher domains; (vi) determination of 12-month prevalence of domains in EHR of 2328 patients with dementia compared to matched patients without dementia. Results:Sixty-three markers were identified and mapped to 13 domains: Care; Home Pressures; Severe Neuropsychiatric; Neuropsychiatric; Cognitive Function; Daily Functioning; Safety; Comorbidity; Symptoms; Diet/Nutrition; Imaging; Increased Multimorbidity; Change in Dementia Drug. Comorbidity was the most prevalent recorded domain in dementia (69%). Home Pressures were the least prevalent domain (1%). Ten domains had a statistically significant higher prevalence in dementia patients, one (Comorbidity) was higher in non-dementia patients, and two (Home Pressures, Diet/Nutrition) showed no association with dementia. Conclusions:EHR captures important markers of dementia-related health. Further research should assess if they indicate dementia progression. These markers could provide the basis for identifying individuals at risk of faster progression and outcome measures for use in research.', 'Objective Data Sources/Study Setting Examine how behavioral health (BH) integration affects health care costs, emergency department (ED) visits, and inpatient admissions. Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases. Study Design Data Collection/Extraction Methods Social network analysis identified care communities (providers sharing a high number of patients) and measured BH integration in terms of how connected, or central, BH providers were to other providers in their community. Multivariable generalized linear models adjusting for age, sex, number of prescriptions, and Charlson comorbidity score were used to estimate the relationship between the centrality of BH providers and health care utilization of BH patients. Used outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy claims data from six Medicaid plans from 2011 to 2013 to identify study outcomes, comorbidities, providers, and health care encounters. Principal Findings Conclusions Behavioral health centrality ranged from 0 (no BH providers) to 0.49. Relative to communities at the median BH centrality (0.06), in 2012, BH patients in communities at the 75th percentile of BH centrality (0.31) had 0.2 fewer admissions, 2.1 fewer all-cause ED visits, and accrued $1,947 fewer costs, on average. Increased behavioral centrality was significantly associated with a reduced number of ED visits, less frequent inpatient admissions, and lower overall health care costs.', 'Background. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine commissioned an environmental scan describing the status of health care integration of oral health and primary care services. Methods. The authors conducted an environmental scan of US integration activities with publications from January 2000 through August 2017. They categorized services as preventive oral health services (POHS) provided by medical care providers, POHS provided by dental providers in nondental settings, preventive health services provided by dental providers, or care coordination using dedicated personnel and technology. The authors chose 4 programs as case studies and interviewed key personnel in each program. One case study illustrates each category of integrated services; additional examples describe category variation. Results. The case study involving Into the Mouth of Babes illustrates medical professionals delivering POHS to children. The case study involving Grace Health presents dental hygienists embedded in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic to provide oral screening, prophylaxis, and education to pregnant women. At HealthPartners, medical care providers refer patients with diabetes to dentists and waive copays for periodontal care. The InterCommunity Health Network Coordinated Care Organization uses dedicated patient coordinators, technology, and coordinated payment and referral mechanisms to facilitate care. Conclusions. Integration of dental and medical care increased access to and coordination of patient care by means of offering health care services traditionally provided by the other profession. Practical Implications. Integration models demonstrate the incorporation of POHS by primary care professionals, the embedding of dental professionals into primary care clinics, and the incorporation of care coordination to increase the delivery of oral health care. Similarly, dentists identify and refer patients with medical needs or preventive gaps to medical homes.', 'To obtain information about the actual use of health care facilities by undocumented women and to identify obstacles they experience in accessing health care facilities. A mixed methods study, with structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, was chosen to obtain a complete understanding. One-hundred undocumented women were recruited. Diversity was sought according to age, origin and reason for being undocumented. Undocumented female immigrants have unmet health care needs (56%) and low health care utilisation. Sixty-nine per cent of the women reported obstacles in accessing health care facilities. These included many personal obstacles such as shame, fear and/or lack of information. Poor language proficiency (OR 0.28;. CI 0.09-0.90) reduces utilisation of primary health care services. Health care utilisation of undocumented women is low. Undocumented women refrain from seeking health care because of personal obstacles. These women need to be identified and informed about their rights, the health care system and the duty of professional confidentiality of doctors. Finally, institutional obstacles to access care should be removed since they strengthen reluctance to seek help.', 'Background: Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for all persons to ensure that the care they receive aligns with their values and preferences. Objective: To evaluate an ACP intervention developed to better meet the needs and priorities of persons with chronic diseases, including mild cognitive impairment. Research Design: A year-long, pre-post intervention using lay community health workers [care coordinator assistants (CCAs)] trained to conduct and document ACP conversations with patients during home health visits with pre-post evaluation. Subjects: The 818 patients were 74.2 years old (mean); 78% women; 51% African American; 43% white. Measures: Documentation of ACP conversation in electronic health record fields and health care utilization outcomes. Results: In this target population ACP documentation rose from 3.4% (pre-CCA training) to 47.9% (post) of patients who had at least 1 discussion about ACP in the electronic health record. In the 1-year preintervention period, there were no differences in admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits between patients who did and did not have ACP discussion. After adjusting for prior hospitalization and ED use histories, ACP discussions were associated with a 34% less probability of hospitalization (hazard ratios, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97), and similar effects are apparent on ED use independent of age and prior ED use effects. Conclusions: Patients with chronic diseases including mild cognitive impairment can engage in ACP conversations with trusted home health care providers. Having ACP conversation is associated with significant reduction in seeking urgent health care and in hospitalizations.', \"We review recently published studies of U.S. health policy and the nation's health care system. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, health inequalities were widening and care was inequitably distributed. Although the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion improved access to care and timely cancer diagnoses, a large proportion of U.S. residents continued to avoid medical care due to concerns about costs, and access to mental health services remains particularly inadequate. Yet more evidence of private insurers' profit-driven misbehaviors and of corruption among medical leaders continues to emerge. Misguided incentives and lax regulation encourages nominally nonprofit health care providers to mimic for-profits' misconduct, and rapacious investors own and control an increasing share of physicians' practices. Pharmaceutical firms wield outsize political influence and devote far more funds to rewarding investors than to research and development effort. Yet despite vigorous efforts by pharma and other commercial interests to denigrate national health insurance, polls indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasing support for such reform.\", \"Background: Informal (dementia) care has economic consequences throughout the health care system. Whilst the health and wellbeing of the care recipient might improve, the health of the caregiver might also change, typically for the worse. Therefore, this analysis aims to examine the association between caregiving intensity and caregivers' health and health care utilization. Data and Methods: The empirical analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data generated by the European Project RightTimePlaceCare (RTPC). RTPC was a prospective cohort study conducted in eight European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom). The health status of 1029 informal caregivers was assessed by measures of psychological wellbeing (GHQ-12) and self-rated overall health (EQ-VAS). Health care utilization was measured by (i) the self-stated proportion of health care use influenced by caregiving and (ii) the probability of at least one visit to a general practitioner within in the last 30 days. The association between caregiving intensity and caregivers' health and health care utilization was assessed by descriptive analysis and multivariate OLS- and probit-models. Results: A higher amount of informal care was significantly related to negative health outcomes for informal caregivers. On average, one additional hour of informal caregiving per day was associated with a decrease of psychological wellbeing and self-rated overall health by 0.16 and 0.42 index points respectively. Furthermore, one more hour of informal caregiving corresponded with increased self-stated proportion of health care use by 0.56 percentage points. However, the claim of increased health care demand due to caregiving as measured by GP visits was only partly confirmed. Conclusion: When evaluating the full economic effect of informal care, the impact of providing care on caregivers' health and health care utilization has to be taken into account.

Methods We linked 1,459 community-dwelling women (mean age 83.6 years) participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Year 16 visit (2002-2004) with their Medicare claims. Five dimensions of sleep health (satisfaction, daytime sleepiness, timing, latency, and duration) were assessed by self-report. The number of impaired dimensions was expressed as a score (range 0-5). Total direct health-care costs and utilization were ascertained during the subsequent 36 months. Results Mean (SD) total health-care costs/year (2017 dollars) increased in a graded manner across the sleep health score ranging from $10,745 ($15,795) among women with no impairment to up to $15,332 ($22,810) in women with impairment in three to five dimensions (p = 0.01). After adjustment for age, race, and enrollment site, women with impairment in three to five dimensions vs. no impairment had greater mean total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.34 [95% CI = 1.13 to 1.60]) and appeared to be at higher risk of hospitalization (odds ratio (OR) 1.31 [95% CI = 0.96 to 1.81]). After further accounting for number of medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms, impairment in three to five sleep health dimensions was not associated with total costs (CR 1.02 [95% CI = 0.86 to 1.22]) or hospitalization (OR 0.91 [95% CI = 0.65 to 1.28]). Poor multidimensional sleep health was not related to outpatient costs or risk of skilled nursing facility stay. Conclusions Older women with poor sleep health have higher subsequent total health-care costs largely attributable to their greater burden of medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms.', 'BackgroundPrimary health care and its strengthening through performance measurement is essential for sustainably working towards universal health coverage. Existing performance frameworks and indicators to measure primary health care capture system functions like governance, financing and resourcing but to a lesser extent the function of services delivery and its heterogeneous nature. Moreover, most frameworks have weak links with routine information systems and national health priorities, especially in the context of high- and middle-income countries. This paper presents the development of a tool that responds to this context with the aim to create primary health care performance intelligence for the 53 countries of the WHO European Region.MethodsThe work builds-off of an existing systematic review on primary care and draws on priorities of current European health policies and available (inter)national information systems. Its development included: (i) reviewing and classifying features of primary care; (ii) constructing a set of tracer conditions; and (iii) mapping existing indicators in the framework resulting from (i). The analysis was validated through a series of reviews: in-person meetings with country-nominated focal points and primary care experts; at-distance expert reviews; and, preliminary testing with country informants.ResultsThe resulting framework applies a performance continuum in the classical approach of structures-processes-outcomes spanning 6 domains - primary care structures, model of primary care, care contact, primary care outputs, health system outcomes, and health outcomes - that are further classified by 26 subdomains and 63 features of primary care. A care continuum was developed using a set of 12 tracer conditions. A total of 139 indicators were mapped to the classification, each with an identified data source to safeguard measurability. Individual indicator passports and a glossary of terms were developed to support the standardization of the findings.ConclusionThe resulting framework and suite of indicators, coined the Primary Health Care Impact, Performance and Capacity Tool (PHC-IMPACT), has the potential to be applied in Europe, closing the gap on existing data collection, analysis and use of performance intelligence for decision-making towards primary health care strengthening.', \"Authors analysed materials of the WHO Conference on European Health Care Reforms, Ljubljana Slovenia, 17 - 20 June 1996. International overview of data obteined by reviewing and abstracting WHO background documentation about Analysis of Current Strategies and about Citizens Choice and Patients' Rights were presented. Epidemiological data and international comparison on the current situation in the health care systems and their prospective reforms were aimed to provide a starting point for the mutual exchange of experience among the participants of the International Conference on Bioethics Health Care under Stress in Bratislava, August 1996.\", 'Objective: To compare health behaviors, physical health outcomes, and health care utilization between children with and without ADHD. Method: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data for children with and without ADHD from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. To investigate the association between ADHD and health outcomes, we estimated the adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) in these groups. Results: Among 10,838 children aged 7 to 18 years with and without ADHD, those with ADHD had significantly higher APRs for overall health problems, physical illness, and injuries than those without ADHD. Despite having health care needs, children with ADHD were less likely than those without ADHD to use health care services. However, there were no significant associations between most health behaviors and ADHD. Conclusion: Increased efforts are needed to provide quality health care services to address the medical conditions of children with ADHD and to enhance their health care utilization when needed.', \"OBJECTIVES. We compared patient satisfaction among adults with diabetes treated in a Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system with the satisfaction of patients treated in a county-funded health care system. We also examined whether satisfaction differences reflected differences in the process of patient care. DESIGN. Cross-sectional telephone survey of patients recruited from outpatient clinics. SUBJECTS. Five hundred and thirty eight adults, including 310 patients from 4 VA clinics and 228 patients from 2 county clinics. MEASURES. Overall satisfaction with care and satisfaction with 6 separate dimensions of care were measured using the Employee Health Care Value Survey. RESULTS. VA patients were more satisfied than were county patients overall and with 5 of 6 dimensions of their care. These differences increased when we adjusted for patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. VA patients reported more diabetes counseling and shorter waiting times to see their doctor. Each of these self-reported process measures was positively correlated with satisfaction and, when taken into account, reduced the differences in satisfaction between the two systems. However, even when we controlled both for patient characteristics and the process of care, VA patients still were more satisfied than were county patients with their care overall as well as with their access to care, communication with providers, and the quality of their health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS. In this study, VA patients with diabetes were more satisfied with their health care than were county patients. Perceived diabetes-related counseling and shorter waiting times contributed to differences between the systems in patient satisfaction but did not explain them completely.\", 'Background: In the Netherlands, ethnic minority populations visit their general practitioner (GP) more often than the indigenous population. An explanation for this association is lacking. Recently, health literacy is suggested as a possible explaining mechanism. Internationally, associations between health literacy and health care use, and between ethnicity and health literacy have been studied separately, but, so far, have not been linked to each other. In the Netherlands, some expectations have been expressed with regard to supposed low health literacy of ethnic minority groups, however, no empirical study has been done so far. The objectives of this study are therefore to acquire insight into the level of health literacy of ethnic minorities in the Netherlands and to examine whether the relationship between ethnicity and health care use can be (partly) explained by health literacy. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to a sample of 2.116 members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (response rate 46%, 89 respondents of non-western origin). Health literacy was measured with the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) which covers nine different domains. The health literacy levels of ethnic minority groups were compared to the indigenous population. A negative binomial regression model was used to estimate the association between ethnicity and GP visits. To examine whether health literacy is an explaining factor in this association, health literacy and interaction terms of health literacy and ethnicity were added into the model. Results: Differences in levels of health literacy were only found between the Turkish population and the indigenous Dutch population. This study also found an association between ethnicity and GP visits. Ethnic minorities visit their GP 33% more often than the indigenous population. Three domains of the HLQ (the ability to navigate the health care system, the ability to find information and to read and understand health information) partly explained the association between ethnicity and GP visits. Conclusions: In general, there are no differences in health literacy between most of the ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands and the indigenous Dutch population. Only the Turkish population scored significantly lower on several health literacy domains. Some domains of health literacy do explain the association between ethnicity and higher frequency of GP visits. Further research is recommended to understand the pathways through which health literacy impacts health care use.', \"The lockdown restrictions that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic have reshaped the way people live, work, and interact with each other. At the same time, it changed the way health-care professionals and national health-care systems around the world are fighting in this battle for public health. Social media (SoMe) have played their informational role in this fight with almost one-third of the world's population being active users of social media platforms. Contemporary health-care systems have tried to find ways to engage more actively with SoMe as Internet users are increasingly searching for health information on social media platforms. As a result, new demand-side levers arise in the health-care sector along with new opportunities and risks for the stakeholders. Our study looked into the responses of 173 health-care professionals in Greece. SoMe are here to stay and the majority of health-care professionals embrace them in their professional lives. Quality in health information and the work context of Greek health-care professionals in our cohort contribute to attitudes and perceptions of social media use in health care.\", \"Introduction: Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) are the most common complication of pregnancy and have been found to have long-term implications for both mother and child. In vulnerable patient populations such as those served at Denver Health, a federally qualified health center the prevalence of PMADs is nearly double the nationally reported rate of 15-20%. Nearly 17% of women will be diagnosed with major depression at some point in their lives and those numbers are twice as high in women who live in poverty. Women also appear to be at higher risk for depression in the child-bearing years. In order to better address these issues, an Integrated Perinatal Mental Health program was created to screen, assess, and treat PMADs in alignment with national recommendations to improve maternal-child health and wellness. This program was built upon a national model of Integrated Behavioral Health already in place at Denver Health. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of physicians, behavioral health providers, public health, and administrators was assembled at Denver Health, an integrated hospital and community health care system that serves as the safety net hospital to the city and county of Denver, CO. This team was brought together to create a universal screen-to-treat process for PMAD's in perinatal clinics and to adapt the existing Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) model into a program better suited to the health system's obstetric population. Universal prenatal and postnatal depression screening was implemented at the obstetric intake visit, a third trimester prenatal care visit, and at the postpartum visit across the clinical system. At the same time, IBH services were implemented across our health system's perinatal care system in a stepwise fashion. This included our women's care clinics as well as the family medicine and pediatric clinics. These efforts occurred in tandem to support all patients and staff enabling a specially trained behavioral health provider (psychologists and L.C.S.W.'s) to respond immediately to any positive screen during or after pregnancy. Results: In August 2014 behavioral health providers were integrated into the women's care clinics. In January 2015 universal screening for PMADs was implemented throughout the perinatal care system. Screening has improved from 0% of women screened at the obstetric care intake visit in August 2014 to >75% of women screened in August 2016. IBH coverage by a licensed psychologist or licensed clinical social worker exists in 100% of perinatal clinics as of January 2016. As well, in order to gain sustainability, the ability to bill same day visits as well as to bill, and be reimbursed for screening and assessment visits, continues to improve and provide for a model that is self-sustaining for the future. Conclusion: Implementation of a universal screening process for PMADs alongside the development of an IBH model in perinatal care has led to the creation of a program that is feasible and has the capacity to serve as a national model for improving perinatal mental health in vulnerable populations.\", 'Introduction: We investigated the size profile of US primary care and behavioral health physician practices since size may impact the ability to institute care management processes (CMPs) that can enhance care quality. Method: We utilized 2009 claims data from a nationwide commercial insurer to estimate practice size by linking providers by tax identification number. We determined the proportion of primary care physicians, psychiatrists, and behavioral health providers practicing in venues of > 20 providers per practice (the lower bound for current CMP practice surveys). Results: Among primary care physicians (n = 350,350), only 2.1% of practices consisted of > 20 providers. Among behavioral health practitioners (n = 146,992) and psychiatrists (n = 44,449), 1.3% and 1.0% of practices, respectively, had > 20 providers. Sensitivity analysis excluding single-physician practices as secondary confirmed findings, with primary care and psychiatrist practices of > 20 providers comprising, respectively, only 19.4% and 8.8% of practices (difference: P < 0.0001). In secondary analyses, bipolar disorder was used as a tracer condition to estimate practice census for a high-complexity, high-cost behavioral health condition; only 1.3-18 patients per practice had claims for this condition. Conclusions: The tax identification number method for estimating practice size has strengths and limitations that complement those of survey methods. The proportion of practices below the lower bound of prior CMP studies is substantial, and care models and policies will need to address the needs of such practices and their patients. Achieving a critical mass of patients for disorder-specific CMPs will require coordination across multiple small practices.', 'In the past 2 decades, societal spending on health care has become an international concern. The United States currently spends more than 1.6 trillion dollars per year on health care approximately 15% of the gross domestic product. The provision of care to critically ill patients accounts for a disproportionate share of these health care dollars-approximately 13% of hospital costs, 4% of national health expenditures, and 0.5% to 1% of the gross domestic product. This enormous investment necessitates careful evaluation of our interventions and their associated expense. Economic evaluation can aid policy makers and health care professionals in comparing the relative and incremental value of disparate and expensive therapies and also inform decisions about which interventions provide good value for the health care dollar. In this review, we will highlight landmark publications over the past 3 decades that have helped to shape the field of economic evaluation for critical care medicine.', 'There is a need for a paradigm shift across mental health in primary care to improve the lives of millions of Europeans. To contribute to this paradigm shift, the European Forum for Primary Care (EFPC-MH) working group for Mental Health, produced a Position Paper for Primary Care Mental Health outlining 14 themes that needed prioritizing. These themes were developed and discussed interactively during the EFPC conferences between 2012 and 2019. The Position Paper on Mental Health gives direction to the necessary improvements over the next ten years. The themes vary from preferable healthcare model to the social determinants highlighting issues such as inequalities. The Statement of Mental Health in Primary Care will be established in cooperation with fellow organizations.', 'Background: Public health and primary care are distinct sectors within western health care systems. Within each sector, work is carried out in the context of organizations, for example, public health units and primary care clinics. Building on a scoping literature review, our study aimed to identify the influencing factors within these organizations that affect the ability of these health care sectors to collaborate with one another in the Canadian context. Relationships between these factors were also explored. Methods: We conducted an interpretive descriptive qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with 74 key informants from three provinces, one each in western, central and eastern Canada, and others representing national organizations, government, or associations. The sample included policy makers, managers, and direct service providers in public health and primary care. Results: Seven major organizational influencing factors on collaboration were identified: 1) Clear Mandates, Vision, and Goals; 2) Strategic Coordination and Communication Mechanisms between Partners; 3) Formal Organizational Leaders as Collaborative Champions; 4) Collaborative Organizational Culture; 5) Optimal Use of Resources; 6) Optimal Use of Human Resources; and 7) Collaborative Approaches to Programs and Services Delivery. Conclusion: While each influencing factor was distinct, the many interactions among these influences are indicative of the complex nature of public health and primary care collaboration. These results can be useful for those working to set up new or maintain existing collaborations with public health and primary care which may or may not include other organizations.', \"Introduction: In 2007, a substantial reform changed the administrative boundaries of the Danish health care system and introduced health care agreements to be signed between municipal and regional authorities. To assess the health care agreements as a tool for coordinating health and social services, a survey was conducted before (2005-2006) and after the reform (2011). Theory and methods: The study was designed on the basis of a modified version of Alter and Hage's framework for conceptualising coordination. Both surveys addressed all municipal level units (n = 271/98) and a random sample of general practitioners (n = 700/853). Results: The health care agreements were considered more useful for coordinating care than the previous health plans. The power relationship between the regional and municipal authorities in drawing up the agreements was described as more equal. Familiarity with the agreements among general practitioners was higher, as was the perceived influence of the health care agreements on their work. Discussion: Health care agreements with specific content and with regular follow-up and systematic mechanisms for organising feedback between collaborative partners exemplify a useful tool for the coordination of health and social services. Conclusion: There are substantial improvements with the new health agreements in terms of formalising a better coordination of the health care system.\", \"Background: While previous research has suggested that health care assistants supporting palliative care work in the community regard the provision of emotional labour as a key aspect of their role, little research has explored the experiences of family carers who are the recipients of such support. Objective: To explore the emotional labour undertaken by health care assistants working in community palliative care from the perspectives of both health care assistants and bereaved family carers. Design: We conducted a qualitative interview study in 2011-2012 with bereaved family carers of cancer patients who had received the services of health care assistants in the community, and health care assistants who provided community palliative care services. Transcripts were coded and analysed for emergent themes using a constant comparative technique. Settings: Three different research sites in the United Kingdom, all providing community palliative care. Participants and methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 bereaved family carers and eight health care assistants. Results: Health care assistants view one of their key roles as providing emotional support to patients and their family carers, and family carers recognise and value this emotional support. Emotional support by health care assistants was demonstrated in three main ways: the relationships which health care assistants developed and maintained on the professional personal boundary; the ability of health care assistants to negotiate clinical/ domestic boundaries in the home; the ways in which health care assistants and family carers worked together to enable the patient to die at home. Conclusion: Through their emotional labour, health care assistants perform an important role in community palliative care which is greatly valued by family carers. While recent reports have highlighted potential dangers in the ambiguity of their role, any attempts to clarify the 'boundaries' of the health care assistant role should acknowledge the advantages health care assistants can bring in bridging potential gaps between healthcare professionals and family carers.

It has been estimated that there were 28 million cancer survivors around the world in 2012. In the UK, for patients diagnosed in 2007, it is predicted that more than half of them will survive their cancer for 5 years or more. A large majority of cancer survivors report unmet supportive care needs and distressing symptoms and adverse long-term consequences related to their cancer. Cancer management could be optimized to better meet patients demand through technology, including mobile health (m-Health). m-Health is defined as the use of mobile communications and network technologies for health care. m-Health can help both patients and health-care professionals and play an important part in managing and delivering cancer care including managing side effects, supporting drug adherence, providing cancer information, planning and follow up and detecting and diagnosing cancer. Health authorities have already published guidelines regulating m-Health to insure patient safety and improve the accountability of its applications.', 'Objective: For patients with an initial primary care (PC) encounter in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that included a mental health diagnosis, we evaluate whether same-day receipt of Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) services is associated with the likelihood of receiving a subsequent mental-health-related encounter in the following 90 days. Method: Using VHA administrative data, we identified 9046 patients who received VHA care for the first time in fiscal year 2009, received a PC encounter that included a mental health diagnosis on the first day of their VHA services and initiated care at a VHA facility that provided PC-MHI services. Using multivariable generalized estimating equations logistic regression, we examined whether receipt of same-day PC-MHI was associated with receipt of a subsequent encounter with a mental health diagnosis within 90 days. Analyses adjusted for Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran status, demographic characteristics, service-connected disability, psychiatric and non-psychiatric diagnoses, and psychotropic medication initiation on the index day of service use. Results: Receipt of same-day PC-MHI services was positively associated with having a mental-health-related encounter in the following 90 days (adjusted odds ratio=2.05; 95% confidence interval=1.66-2.54). Conclusions: PC-MHI services may enhance mental health continuation of care among PC patients with mental health conditions who initiate VHA services. Published by Elsevier Inc.', \"This study reports on a statewide survey of medical and behavioral health professionals to advance the knowledge base on the benefits and obstacles to delivering integrated pediatric health care. Surveys distributed in 3 statewide provider networks were completed by 110 behavioral health specialists (BHSs) and 111 primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey content documented their perceptions about key services, benefits, barriers, and needed opportunities related to integrated care. Factor analyses identified 8 factors, and other items were examined individually. We compared responses by specialty group (BHS vs PCP) and integrated care experience (no vs yes). The findings revealed differences across domains by specialty subgroup. In several cases, BHS (vs PCP) respondents, especially those with integrated care experience, reported lower benefits, higher barriers, and fewer resource requests. The implications of these results for enhancing care integration development, delivery, training, and research are discussed along with the study's limitations and empirical literature.\", 'Evidence of the health-promoting influence of primary care has been accumulating ever since researchers have been able to distinguish primary care from other aspects of the health services delivery system. This evidence shows that primary care helps prevent illness and death, regardless of whether the care is characterized by supply of primary care physicians, a relationship with a source of primary care, or the receipt of important features of primary care. The evidence also shows that primary care (in contrast to specialty care) is associated with a more equitable distribution of health in populations, a finding that holds in both cross-national and within-national studies. The means by which primary care improves health have been identified, thus suggesting ways to improve overall health and reduce differences in health across major population subgroups.', \"Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and hospitals are investing in improving !'population health, by which they nearly always mean the health of the population of patients attributed by Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurers to their organizations. But population health can and should also mean the health of the entire population in a geographic area. We present arguments for and against ACOs and hospitals investing in affecting the socioeconomic determinants of health to improve the health of the population in their geographic area, and we provide examples of ACOs and hospitals that are doing so in a limited way. These examples suggest that ACOs and hospitals can work with other organizations in their community to improve population health. We briefly present recent proposals for such coalitions and for how they could be financed to be sustainable.\", \"Objective. The absence of a more significant improvement in cancer survival in countries such as the UK and Denmark may be partly rooted in delayed care-seeking among cancer patients. Past research on patient delay has mainly focused on patient characteristics (e. g. sociodemographic and psychological factors and symptom recognition) as causes of delayed care-seeking, while few studies have examined how the organizational structure of health care systems may influence patients' reflections on seeking care. The aim of this study was to explore this relationship. Design. The analysis presented is based on semi-structured interviews with 30 cancer patients and their families. Results. The article raises two hypotheses on the relationship between structural elements of a health care system and people's reflections on seeking health care: (1) Gatekeeping introduces an asymmetrical relationship between the patient and the GP which potentially results in self-restricting care-seeking, (2) Continuity in the doctor-patient relationship may negatively influence patient reflections on access to health care, as the focus shifts from the medical issues of the consultation to reflections on how to properly interact with the GP and the system in which she/he is situated. Conclusion. It is concluded that these hypotheses form a sound basis for further primary care research on how the organizational structure of health care systems influences patient reflections on access to medical care.\", \"Children with medical complexity have high health service utilization and health expenditures that can impose significant financial burdens. This study examined these issues for families with children enrolled in US private health plans. Using IBM Watson/Truven Analytics MarketScan (R) commercial claims and encounters data (2012-2014), we analyzed through regression models, the differences in health care utilization and spending of disaggregated health care services by health plan types and children's medical complexity levels. Children in consumer-driven and high-deductible plans had much higher out-of-pocket spending and cost shares than those in health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Children with complex chronic conditions had higher service utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures while having lower cost shares on various categories of services than those without any chronic condition. Compared to families covered by PPOs, those with high-deductible or consumer-driven plans were 2.7 and 1.7 times more likely to spend over US$1000 out of pocket on their children's medical care, respectively. Families with higher complexity levels were more likely to experience financial burdens from expenditures on children's medical services. In conclusion, policymakers and families with children need to be cognizant of the significant financial burdens that can arise from children's complex medical needs and health plan demand-side cost sharing.\", \"Objective To explore why and how health systems are engaging in care delivery redesign (CDR)-defined as the variety of tools and organizational change processes health systems use to pursue the Triple Aim. Study Setting A purposive sample of 24 health systems across 4 states as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Comparative Health System Performance Initiative. Study Design An exploratory qualitative study design to gain an on the ground understanding of health systems' motivations for, and approaches to, CDR, with the goals of identifying key dimensions of CDR, and gauging the depth of change that is possible based on the particular approaches to redesign care being adopted by the health systems. Data Collection Semi-structured telephone interviews with health system executives and physician organization leaders from 24 health systems (n = 162). Principal Findings We identify and define 13 CDR activities and find that the health systems' efforts are varied in terms of both the combination of activities they are engaging in and the depth of innovation within each activity. Health system executives who report strong internal motivation for their CDR efforts describe more confidence in their approach to CDR than those who report strong external motivation. Health system leaders face uncertainty when implementing CDR due to a limited evidence base and because of the slower than expected pace of payment change. Conclusions The ability to validly and reliably measure CDR activities-particularly across varying organizational contexts and markets-is currently limited but is key to better understanding CDR's impact on intended outcomes, which is important for guiding both health system decision making and policy making.\", \"Background: Maternal mental health problems affect up to 20% of women, with potentially deleterious effects to the mother and family. To address this serious problem, a Maternal Mental Health Program (MMHP) using a shared care approach was developed. Ashared care approach can promote an efficient use of limited specialized maternal mental health services, strengthen collaboration between the maternal mental health care team and primary care physicians, increase access to maternal mental health care services, and promote primary care provider competence in treating maternal mental health problems. Aim: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of a MMHP using a shared care approach on maternal anxiety and depression symptoms of participants, the satisfaction of women and referring physicians, and whether the program met the intents of shared care approach (such as quick consultation, increased knowledge, and confidence of primary care physicians). Methods: We used a pre and post cross-sectional study design to evaluate women's depression and anxiety symptoms and the satisfaction of women and their primary care health provider with the program. Findings: Depression and anxiety symptoms significantly improved with involvement with the program. Women and physicians reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. Physician knowledge and confidence treating maternal mental health problems improved. Conclusions: Shared care can be an effective and efficient way to provide maternal mental health care in primary health care settings where resources are limited.\", 'We consider an economy where most of the health care is publicly provided, and where there is waiting time for several types of treatments. Private health care without waiting time is an option for the patients in the public health queue. We show that although patients with low waiting costs will choose public treatment, they may be better off with waiting time than without. The reason is that waiting time induces patients with high waiting costs to choose private treatment, thus reducing the cost of public health care that everyone pays for. Even if higher quality (i.e. zero waiting time) can be achieved at no cost, the self-selection induced redistribution may imply that it is socially optimal to provide health care publicly and at an inferior quality level. We give a detailed discussion of the circumstances in which it is optimal to have waiting time for public health treatment. Moreover, we study the interaction between this quality decision and the optimal tax/subsidy on private health care. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from South Korea, where daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and parents-in-law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a parent-in-law with functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that parent-in-law, but a parent-in-law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter-in-law's health. We compare results for the daughter-in-law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of the instruments for the daughter sample. Our results show that providing informal care has significant adverse effects along multiple dimensions of health for daughter-in-law and daughter caregivers in South Korea.

To evaluate the financial impact for primary care practices of integrating behavioral health services. Microsimulation model. We simulated patients and providers at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), non-FQHCs in urban and rural high-poverty areas, and practices outside of high-poverty areas surveyed by the National Association of Community Health Centers, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and National Health Interview Survey. A collaborative care model (CoCM), involving telephone-based follow-up from a behaviorist care manager, or a primary care behaviorist model (PCBM), involving an in-clinic behaviorist. Net revenue change per full-time physician. When behavioral health integration services were offered only to Medicare patients, net revenue was higher under CoCM (averaging $25,026 per MD in year 1 and $28,548/year in subsequent years) than PCBM (-$7052 in year 1 and -$3706/year in subsequent years). When behavioral health integration services were offered to all patients and were reimbursed by Medicare and private payers, only practices adopting the CoCM approach consistently gained net revenues. The outcomes of the model were sensitive to rates of patient referral acceptance, presentation, and therapy completion, but the CoCM approach remained consistently financially viable whereas PCBM would not be in the long-run across practice types. New Medicare payments may offer financial viability for primary care practices to integrate behavioral health services, but this viability depends on the approach toward care integration.', \"Public Significance Statement Frontline health care workers in the era of COVID-19 need access to emotional support services. This article provides a framework to guide health care institutions in developing emotional and mental health supports for their workforce during these unprecedented times. Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are experiencing a range of emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including anxiety, traumatic stress, and burnout. As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or stepped care model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs. Employing the MESH Framework may also facilitate health care institutions' ability to meet the fourth aim of the Quadruple Aims of Health Care to ensure a healthy workforce for this and future crises.\", 'The most important predictor of quality of health care across all racial and ethnic groups is access, especially insurance status and the ability to pay for health care. If we consider populations with equal access to health care, two groups emerge with differing qualities of health care: non-minority and minority populations. When studies control for the stage of disease at presentation, comorbidities, severity of illness, and other variables, substantial differences in health care based on race and ethnicity can still be found. Raising the consciousness of this issue is an important step toward recognizing and eliminating health care disparities.', 'Many children are treated for mental health disorders in primary care settings. The system of care (SOC) provides a framework for collaboration among pediatric mental health providers, but it is unclear if youth treated for mental health disorders in primary care receive such coordination. At the South Boston Community Health Center from September /2012 to August 2013 for 74 individuals 18 years, the odds of contact with SOC agencies (mental health, education, child protective services, juvenile justice and developmental disabilities) were compared for mental health treatment in primary versus specialty care. The odds of SOC contact within primary care were lower compared to specialty care (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.29-0.66), specifically for mental health (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.25-1.2), education (OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.050-0.28), and child protective services (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.22-1.9). As care coordination may improve health outcomes, increased support and education for care coordination specific to youth treated for mental health disorders in primary care settings may be warranted.', \"In 1999, the multidisciplinary Tavistock group prepared a generic statement of ethical principles to govern health care systems. This paper elaborates on these principles in two directions. First, it develops a set of quality standards, based on ethical principles, intended to regulate health care delivery and service management. Second, it focuses them on 'publicly oriented' (not necessarily governmental) as opposed to 'for profit' (not necessarily private) services. We propose ten principles or quality standards for these services, part of which relate to the individual patients, others to the community. They are political as well as technical, and can be used to inspire health policies, contracts issued by governments, and identification of partners by aid agencies. We analyse their application in key areas of health care by publicly oriented and for-profit health care organizations standards in developing countries, and conclude that the latter are unlikely to adopt the proposed standards. We further elaborate on the implications of the standards for publicly oriented services, focusing on care delivery and patient-centred care, family and community medicine, services management and disease control. Using these criteria for a renewed compact between authorities, health professionals and communities may help to motivate health professionals by bridging the gap between their professional and social-political identity.

This paper describes an underserved rural community in which health care initiatives increased access to comprehensive care. Over a three-year period, use of preventive services increased, whereas emergency room visits and hospitalizations at the community hospital decreased. Low birthweight, risk of congenital syphilis and childhood tuberculosis, and child mortality all decreased. Provision of comprehensive services was met with increased use of preventive health care and improved health outcomes in this rural community.', 'Background: Primary care providers (PCP) differ in their ability to address the needs and reduce use of costly services among complex Medicaid beneficiaries. Among PCPs, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded health centers (HCs) are shown to provide high-value care. Objective: We compared health care utilization of complex Medicaid managed care beneficiaries whose PCPs were HCs versus 3 other groups. Research Design: Cross-sectional study using propensity score matching comparing health care use by provider type, controlling for demographics, health status, and other covariates. Subjects: California Medicaid administrative data for complex adult managed care beneficiaries with at least 1 primary care visit in 2018. Measures: Primary and specialty care evaluation & management visits and services; emergency department (ED) visits; and hospitalizations. PCPs included HCs, clinics not funded by HRSA, solo, and group practice providers. Results: HRSA-funded HCs had lower predicted rates of specialty evaluation & management and other services than all others; lower predicted probability of any ED visits than clinics not funded by HRSA [54% (95% CI: 53%-55%) vs. 56% (95% CI: 55%-57%)] and group practice providers [51% (95% CI: 51%-52%) vs. 52% (95% CI: 52%-53%)]; and lower PP of any hospitalizations than solo [20% (95% CI: 19%-20%) vs. 23% (95% CI: 22%-24%)] and group practice providers [21% (95% CI: 20%-21%) vs. 24% (95% CI: 23%-24%)]. Conclusions: Differences in HC care delivery and practices were associated with lower use of specialty, ED, and hospitalization visits compared with other PCPs for complex Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. Understanding the underlying reasons for these utilization differences may promote better outcomes among these patients.', 'Objectives. To explore the effects of community-level factors an access to any behavioral health care and specialty behavioral health care. Data. Healthcare for Communities household survey data, merged to supplemental data from the 1990 Census Area Resource File, 1995 U.S. Census Bureau Small Area Estimates, and 1994 HMO enrollment data. Study Design. We use a random intercept model to estimate the influences of community-level factors on access to any outpatient care, any behavioral health care conditional on having received outpatient care, and any specialty behavioral health care conditional on having received behavioral health care. Data Collection. HCC data were collected in 1997 from about 10,000 households nationwide but clustered in 60 sites. Principal Findings. Individuals in areas with greater HMO presence have better overall access to care, which in turn affects access to behavioral health care; individuals in poorer communities have less access to specialty care compared to individuals in wealthier communities. Conclusions. Our findings of lower access to specialty care among those in poor communities raises concerns about the appropriateness and quality of the behavioral health care they are receiving. More generally, the findings suggest the importance of considering the current status and expected evolution of HMO penetration and the income level in a community when devising health care policy.', \"Basically, the workshop aims to raise and collect input to Part 2 (Health care process and workflow), currently under development, of the European standard EN 13940 Health informatics - System of concepts to support continuity of care, the general objective of which is to enable communication at the semantic level between information systems in health care in the perspective of continuity of care. Its scope encompasses identifying the various processes and process objects involved, taking into consideration resource management aspects, responsibilities of health care providers, and means for patients' participation. While the process description and concept system model is meant as a tool for the development of information systems, it may also be used for enterprise analysis and form the basis for organizational decisions and more widely organizational developments that are not inherently tied to the use of ICT.\", \"Background Many countries worldwide have experienced reductions in provision of formal long-term care services amidst rising need for care. Provision of unpaid care, meanwhile, has grown. This includes care provided by young people. Care responsibilities can affect a young people's health, education and employment. We aimed to investigate the impacts on the employment and health of young people aged 16 to 25 of providing care, and the associated individual and public expenditure costs. Methods We examined employment, earnings and health impacts for individuals, and a range of economic impacts for society, focusing on young people aged 16 to 25 providing unpaid care in England. We applied regression analysis to data from three waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2013/2015, 2014/2016, and 2015/2017) to compare employment and health outcomes among carers and non-carers, and two-part Generalised Linear Models to estimate costs. To address potential selection bias, we then used propensity score matching methods to explore outcomes for a matched sub-sample of young adult carers who started providing care at baseline (2014/16). Results Young people aged 16 to 25 who provided care at baseline (2014/16) were less likely to be in employment, had lower earnings from paid employment, and had poorer mental and physical health at follow-up (2015/17) compared to young people of the same age who were not providing care at baseline.. There were substantial costs to the state of young adults providing care from lower tax revenue, welfare benefit payments, and health service use. In aggregate, these costs amounted to 1048 pound million annually in 2017. Conclusions High individual impacts and costs to the state of providing unpaid care, and the potential of such impacts to compound existing inequalities, have many implications for policy and practice in the health, social care, employment and welfare benefits sectors. In particular, the findings reinforce the case for reducing the need for young people to provide unpaid care, for example through better provision of formal care services, and to provide ongoing support for those young people whodoprovide care. As impacts are seen in a number of domains, support needs to be multidimensional.\", 'Most health care quality improvement efforts target measures of health care structures, processes, and/or outcomes. Structural measures examine relatively fixed aspects of health care delivery such as physical plant and human resources. Process measures, the focus of the largest proportion of quality improvement efforts, assess specific transactions in clinical-patient encounters, such as use of appropriate surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, which are expected to improve outcomes. Outcome measures, which comprise quality of life endpoints as well as morbidity and mortality, are of greatest interest to clinicians and patients, but entail the greatest complexity, as the majority of variance in outcomes is attributable to patient and environmental factors that may not be readily modifiable. Selecting among structure, process, and outcome measures for quality improvement efforts generally will be dictated by the specific clinical situation for which improvement is desired. One aspect of health care quality that has received a great deal of attention in recent years is the relationship between Surgical volume and health outcomes. Volume, an inherent characteristic of a health care facility or provider, is generally considered a structural measure of quality. Many studies have demonstrated a positive association between volume and outcomes, and policymakers in the private and public sectors have begun to consider volume in certification and reimbursement decisions. The volume-outcome association is not without controversy, however. Most studies in the field are limited by the nature of the administrative data on which they are based, and some Studies have found that variation in quality within volume quantiles exceeds differences between quantiles. Moreover, regionalization driven by a focus on volume may exert adverse effects on access to care. The movement for health care quality improvement faces substantial methodological, clinical, financial, and political challenges. Despite these challenges, it is a movement that is gaining momentum, and the emphasis on quality in health care delivery is likely only to increase in the future. It is crucial, therefore, that physicians assume increasing leadership roles in efforts to define, measure, report, and improve quality of care. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Research methods: We conducted 36 qualitative interviews with neonatal health care providers and hospital administrators and analysed data using a descriptive interpretive approach. Setting: 10 Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units in a single, integrated health care system in one Canadian province. Findings: Three major themes emerged: (1) providing family-centred care, (2) working amidst health care system challenges, and (3) recommending improvements to the health care system. The overarching theme was that the health care system was making 'too much noise' for health care providers and hospital administrators to provide family-centred care in waysthat would benefit infants and their families. Recommended improvements included: refining staffing models, enhancing professional development, providing tools to deliver consistent care, recognising parental capacity to be involved in care, strengthening continuity of care, supporting families to be with their infant, and designing family-friendly environments. Conclusion: When implementing family-centred care initiatives, health care providers and hospital administrators need to consider the complexity of providing care in Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units, and recognise that health care system changes may be necessary to optimise implementation.

We used a quasi-experimental design with difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses to examine changes in preventative health care delivery over 3 time periods in Medicaid expansion compared with nonexpansion states.Subjects:We included low-income (<138% federal poverty level) nonelderly (age younger than 65y) adults residing in 46 US states.Measures:Our predictor was residing in a Medicaid expansion state (24 states) versus nonexpansion state (19 states). Our primary outcomes were preventative health care services, which we categorized as cancer screening (breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer); cardiovascular risk reduction (serum cholesterol screening in low-risk groups, serum cholesterol monitoring in high-risk groups, and aspirin use); diabetes care (serum cholesterol monitoring, hemoglobin A1c monitoring, foot examination, eye examination, and influenza vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination); and other primary care measures [influenza vaccination, alcohol use screening, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening].Results:Survey responses from 500,495 low-income nonelderly adults from 2012 to 2017 were included in the analysis, representing 68.2 million US adults per year. Of the 15 outcomes evaluated, we did not detect statistically significant differences in cancer screening (3 outcomes), cholesterol screening or monitoring (2 outcomes), diabetes care (6 outcomes), or alcohol use screening (1 outcome) in expansion compared with nonexpansion states. Aspirin use (DiD 8.8%, P<0.001), influenza vaccination (DiD 1.4%, P=0.016), and HIV screening (DiD 1.9%, P=0.004) increased in expansion states compared with nonexpansion states.Conclusions:Medicaid expansion was associated with an increase in aspirin use, influenza vaccination, and HIV screening in expansion states. Despite improvements in access to care, including health insurance, having a primary care doctor, and routine visits, Medicaid expansion was not associated with improvements in cancer screening, cholesterol monitoring, diabetes care, or alcohol use screening. Our findings highlight implementation challenges in delivering high-quality primary care to low-income populations.', \"As interprofessional education (IPE) becomes more common in student training programs, reliable and valid scales are needed to measure students' perceptions of the experience. The Attitudes Toward Health Care Teams Scale (ATHCTS) was developed to measure students' attitudes toward IPE programs using 14 items loaded on two factors. In this paper, we used the ATHCTS scale to assess the effects of a three-semester long health care IPE program on three cohorts of nurse practitioner, occupational therapy, and physical therapy graduate students with three measurement points across two university sites (N = 367). Confirmatory factor analysis on the baseline data of the first cohort revealed unacceptable fit indices; in addition, not all items were applicable, some items had double or low factor loadings, and positively and negatively worded items loaded on separate factors, indicating potential answering bias, and both factors were highly correlated. We thus conducted further item analyses and propose a short version of the ATHCTS using six items with one reverse coded item, describing the quality of interprofessional care in a more parsimonious way. The factor structure of the six-item version was tested using confirmatory factor analysis on the baseline data of cohort 2 and 3. Results were compared to the 14-item version, and fit indices confirmed a better fit to the data than the old version. Using the shortened scale, student attitudes were compared over the course of the program and between both sites. Results showed that site 2 students' attitudes remained very positive over time, while site 1 students' attitudes declined significantly. We suggest this finding is related to the consistency of team membership at site 2 and discuss the implications for IPE program design.\", 'Health care delivery and payment systems are moving rapidly toward value-based care. To be successful in this new environment, providers must consistently deliver high-quality, evidence-based, and coordinated care to patients. This study assesses whether Project ECHO (R) (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) GEMH (geriatric mental health)a remote learning and mentoring program-is an effective strategy to address geriatric mental health challenges in rural and underserved communities. Thirty-three teleECHO clinic sessions connecting a team of specialists to 54 primary care and case management spoke sites (approximately 154 participants) were conducted in 10 New York counties from late 2014 to early 2016. The curriculum consisted of case presentations and didactic lessons on best practices related to geriatric mental health care. Twenty-six interviews with program participants were conducted to explore changes in geriatric mental health care knowledge and treatment practices. Health insurance claims data were analyzed to assess changes in health care utilization and costs before and after program implementation. Findings from interviews suggest that the program led to improvements in clinician geriatric mental health care knowledge and treatment practices. Claims data analysis suggests that emergency room costs decreased for patients with mental health diagnoses. Patients without a mental health diagnosis had more outpatient visits and higher prescription and outpatient costs. Telementoring programs such as Project ECHO GEMH may effectively build the capacity of frontline clinicians to deliver high-quality, evidence-based care to older adults with mental health conditions and may contribute to the transformation of health care delivery systems from volume to value.', \"Focusing on key principles and objectives of the health care reform in Austria, financing, planning, and decision-making within the new structures are discussed.

Health Care as a subject in the medical curriculum has been integrated in the course units of social medicine at the Medical University Graz. The subject focuses on social security issues and health care services. The extent of training, however, does not qualify medical students for management functions in health care.\", 'Objectives Although recent health care reform efforts have focused on minimizing high cost health care utilization, the relationship between acute care use and health care expenditures among certain vulnerable populations such as Medicaid-insured children remains poorly understood. We sought to evaluate the association between acute care utilization and health care expenditures and to identify characteristics associated with high spending. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicaid-enrolled children 1-21 years old from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016. Children were categorized by acute care use (including emergency department and urgent care visits) as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more visits. Our main outcomes were annualized spending, total per-member-per-year spending, and acute care-related per-member-per-year spending. Results There were 5.1 million Medicaid-enrolled children that comprised the study cohort, accounting for US $32.6 billion in total spending. Children with 4 or more acute care visits were more likely to be younger than 2 years or older than 14 years, female, and have a chronic condition. Children with 4 or more acute care visits consisted of only 4% of the cohort but accounted for 15% (US $4.7 billion) of the total spending. Increasing acute care visits were associated with increasing total annualized spending in adjusted analyses (P < 0.001). This association was disproportionately observed in older age groups and children without chronic medical conditions. Conclusions Medicaid spending for children increases with increasing acute care use; this trend was disproportionately observed in older age groups and children without chronic medical conditions. Improved understanding of factors contributing to frequent acute care utilization and disproportionate spending is needed to potentially reduce unnecessary health care costs in these pediatric populations.', 'Background This paper aims to assess the barriers and solutions to the delivery of eye care in primary care settings and solutions to improve the use of comprehensive eye care among Indigenous Australians. Design, setting, participants Qualitative, mixed method study participants include Aboriginal community members, and health and eye care providers in urban, rural and remote settings. Main outcome measures Present evidence for health care providers to better understand and address some of the barriers that limit access to eye care in primary care settings. Results Patient perspectives on barriers to accessing eye care and reasons they choose to seek care or not are presented. Health system barriers identified by health and eye care providers are also presented. Additionally, key enablers for improving access to eye care through primary care services are identified. Conclusion Primary health care services have an important role in Indigenous eye health. There is a critical role for primary care in the coordination of the patient journey and cooperating with other services to improve access to comprehensive eye care. Through improved provision of primary eye care, monitoring of Indigenous eye health indicators and supporting patients to access eye care, it is possible to close the gap for vision.', \"Background To assess the quality of child health services in primary health care (PHC) facilities in Calabar, south-east Nigeria. Design Cross-sectional, descriptive design. Methods Key informant interviews, structured observation, self-administered questionnaire and focus group discussion. Setting Calabar, south-east Nigeria. Participants All 10 PHC facilities in Calabar, 252 PHC workers serving in the facilities, and 76 mothers whose children received care in the facilities. Outcome measures Adequacy of structure (equipment and personnel); process (diagnosis, training and knowledge, use of national case-management algorithm, and supervision), and output (clients' satisfaction). Main results PHC facilities were adequately equipped to the extent of providing immunization services and management of diarrhoea but not for other aspects of care expected of a PHC centre, including management of acute respiratory infections (ARI), a common problem in children in the region. Supply of essential drugs was inadequate in all centres and facilities for emergency care were lacking. Many of the health care workers (68.3%) had adequate training in immunization, and their knowledge scores on immunization issues (62%) was higher than in other aspect of PHC. Use of the national case management algorithm was low among PHC workers. Results of the focus group discussions with mothers showed that a few perceived quality of care to be poor. The main concerns were long waiting time, lack of essential drugs, and attitude of the health workers. Conclusions Inadequacy in the quality of child health services in PHC facilities is a product of failures in a range of quality measures - structural (lack of equipment and essential drugs), process failings (non-use of the national case management algorithm and lack of a protocol of systematic supervision of health workers). Efforts to improve the quality of child health services provided by PHC workers in the study setting and similar locales in less developed countries should focus not only on resource-intensive structural improvements, but also on cheap, cost-effective measures that address actual delivery of services (process), especially the proper use of national guidelines for case management, and meaningful supervision.\", 'Background: Care home residents in England have variable access to health care services. There is currently no coherent policy or consensus about the best arrangements to meet these needs. The purpose of this review was to explore the evidence for how different service delivery models for care home residents support and/or improve wellbeing and health-related outcomes in older people living and dying in care homes. Methods: We conceptualised models of health care provision to care homes as complex interventions. We used a realist review approach to develop a preliminary understanding of what supported good health care provision to care homes. We completed a scoping of the literature and interviewed National Health Service and Local Authority commissioners, providers of services to care homes, representatives from the Regulator, care home managers, residents and their families. We used these data to develop theoretical propositions to be tested in the literature to explain why an intervention may be effective in some situations and not others. We searched electronic databases and related grey literature. Finally the findings were reviewed with an external advisory group. Results: Strategies that support and sustain relational working between care home staff and visiting health care professionals explained the observed differences in how health care interventions were accepted and embedded into care home practice. Actions that encouraged visiting health care professionals and care home staff jointly to identify, plan and implement care home appropriate protocols for care, when supported by ongoing facilitation from visiting clinicians, were important. Contextual factors such as financial incentives or sanctions, agreed protocols, clinical expertise and structured approaches to assessment and care planning could support relational working to occur, but of themselves appeared insufficient to achieve change. Conclusion: How relational working is structured between health and care home staff is key to whether health service interventions achieve health related outcomes for residents and their respective organisations. The belief that either paying clinicians to do more in care homes and/or investing in training of care home staff is sufficient for better outcomes was not supported.', \"Background: Equity in health care across all social groups is a major goal in health care policy. Immigrants may experience more mental health problems than natives, but we do not know the extent to which they seek help from primary health care services. This study aimed to determine a) the rate immigrants use primary health care services for mental health problems compared with Norwegians and b) the association between length of stay, reason for immigration and service use among immigrants. Methods: National register data covering all residents in Norway and all consultations with primary health care services were used. We conducted logistic regression analyses to compare Norwegians' with Polish, Swedish, German, Pakistani and Iraqi immigrants' odds of having had a consultation for a mental health problem (P-consultation). Results: After accounting for background variables, all immigrants groups, except Iraqi men had lower odds of a P-consultation than their Norwegian counterparts. A shorter length of stay was associated with lower odds of a P-consultation. Conclusions: Service use varies by country of origin and patterns are different for men and women. There was some evidence of a possible 'healthy migrant worker' effect among the European groups. Together with previous research, our findings however, suggest that Iraqi women and Pakistanis in particular, may experience barriers in accessing care for mental health problems.\", 'Background: The sustainability of health and social care has led to an imperative to shift the balance of care to communities and support person-centered, integrated, preventive, comanaged, and sustainable care. The digital tool set can support this shift; however, it must extend beyond a clinical focus to include broader personal, social, and environmental needs, experiences, and outcomes. The existing digital health and care design and user requirements literature focuses mainly on specific digital products or design methods. There is little whole-system or whole-of-life consideration, which is crucial to enacting more significant transformations that span different groups and domains. Objective: This study aimed to present a set of recurring user requirements and themes for comanaged digital health and care services derived from the body of co-design projects within a digital health and care program. This study aimed to enable people and organizations looking to reorient their approach to health and care research and delivery from a system-led and condition-specific approach to a more person-centric, whole-of-life model. Methods: Participatory design formed the core methodological approach in underlying the design research, from which user requirements were derived. The process of surfacing requirements involved a selection framework for the identification of eligible projects and a structured review process to consolidate user requirements. Results: This paper presents a set of 14 common user requirements that resulted from a review of co-design projects. The findings demonstrate overlapping and reinforcing sets of needs from citizens and care professionals related to how data are comanaged to improve care and outcomes. This paper discusses the alignment, contrasts, and gaps with broader, comparable literature. It highlights consensus around requirements for personal health storytelling, sharing data on care experiences and how this can support personalized guidance, visualize trends to support decision-making, and generally improve dialog between a citizen and care professionals. These findings identify gaps around how groups and networks of people engage, posing difficult questions for people designing support services as some of the user requirements are not easily met by organizations operating in silos. Conclusions: This study proposes future recommendations for citizens as active, informed, and consenting partners using new forms of privacy-preserving digital infrastructure that puts the citizen in firm control. It is also recommended that these findings be used by people developing new digital services to ensure that they can start with knowledge of the broader user requirement context. This should inform domain-specific research and development questions and processes. Further work is needed to extend these common requirements to more explicitly consider the trust framework required when citizens comanage their data and care across a broad range of formal and informal actors. Consideration of how authority, delegation, and trust function between members of the public will be critical.', \"Background The digital transformation of healthcare enables new ways of working in cancer care directing attention on the digital skills of healthcare professionals. This systematic review aims to identify existing evidence about digital skills among health care professionals in cancer care to identify the needs for future education and research.Methods Database searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and ERIC to identify studies until March 2023. The inclusion criteria were digital skills of health care professionals in cancer care as described by themselves, other health care professionals, patients or significant others. The CASP tool was used for quality assessment of the studies. Data was analysed following inductive content analysis.Results The search produced 4563 records, of which 24 studies were included (12 qualitative, 10 quantitative, 1 mixed methods design and 1 strategy paper). Four main categories were identified describing HCPs' required skills, existing skills and development areas of digital skills in cancer care: Skills for information technology, Skills for ethical practice, Skills for creating a human-oriented relationship and Skills for digital education and support. In development areas, one more main category, Skills for implementing digital health, was identified.Conclusion The digital skills of health care professionals in cancer care are multifaceted and fundamental for quality cancer care. The skills need to be assessed to provide education based on actual learning needs. The review findings can be used for education and research in this field.\", 'Objective: We sought to examine the extent to which reported barriers to health care services differ between American Indians (AIs) and non-Hispanic Whites (Whites). Methods: A statewide stratified random sample of Minnesota health care program enrollees was surveyed. Responses from AI and White adult enrollees (n = 1281) and parents of child enrollees (n = 572) were analyzed using logistic regression models that account for the complex sample design. Barriers examined include: financial, access, and cultural barriers, confidence/trust in providers, and discrimination. Results: Both AIs and Whites report barriers to health care access. However, a greater proportion of AIs report barriers in most categories. Among adults, AIs are more likely to report racial discrimination, cultural misunderstandings, family/work responsibilities, and transportation difficulties, whereas Whites are more likely to report being unable to see their preferred doctor. A higher proportion of adult enrollees compared with parents of child enrollees report barriers in most categories; however, differences between parents of AIs and White children are more substantial. In addition to racial discrimination and cultural misunderstandings, parents of AI children are more likely than parents of White enrollees to report limited clinic hours, lack of Conclusions: Although individuals have enrolled in health care programs and have access to care, barriers to using these services remain. Significant differences between AIs and Whites involve issues of trust, respect, and discrimination. Providers must address barriers experienced by AIs to improve accessibility, acceptability, and quality of care for AI health care consumers.', \"Children with medical complexity have ongoing health needs that may require dependence on medical technologies. While hospital admissions are an important focus of care delivery for these children, a majority of the time they are cared for in their own homes. Parents' report feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the scope of their responsibilities, but they become sophisticated care providers and assume greater authority when providing their children's care at home. Communication, decision-making, and dealing with conflict with members of health care teams have been central concerns in parents' reports of their home health care experiences. The objective is to review literature on relational aspects of parent and home health care provider care practices for children with medical complexity receiving home health care services. A narrative review was conducted. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, PsychINFO, ERIC, and CINAHL databases for English language studies published since database inception was carried out. Eligible studies focused on relational aspects of parent and home health care provider care practices for children with medical complexity receiving home health care services. Nine empirical studies were selected for this review. Literature describes parents' and providers' experiences managing a child with medical complexity in the home and the effects for the family and the parent-health care provider relationship. Parents want to be actively involved in all aspects of care that affects their child and ultimately their family. Further investigation is needed to better understand relational aspects of parenthome health care provider care practices to support child/family health and well-being in the home setting.\", \"Background: Health care is provided under the conditions in which people live and under the rules and regulations of a prevailing health system. As a consequence, 'local' circumstances are an important determinant of the actual care that can be provided and its effects on the health of individuals and populations. This plays in particular, but not exclusively, a role in community - based primary health care. Although this is generally accepted, there is little insight in the impact of the setting and context inwhich health care is provided on the outcome of care. Aim: This paper argues the case to use this natural variation within and between countries as an opportunity to be used as a form of natural experiment in health research. Arguments: We argue that analysing and comparing outcomes across settings, that is comparative outcomes of interventions that have been performed under different health care conditions will improve the understanding of how the real - life setting in which health care is provided - including the health system, the socio - economic circumstances and prevailing cultural values - do determine outcome of care. Recommendations: To facilitate comparison of research findings across health systems and different socio - economic and cultural contexts, we recommend a more detailed reporting of the conditions and circumstances under which health research has been performed. A set of core variables is proposed for studies in primary health care.\", 'We summarize recent data on health and health care in the United States. Many millions suffer financial distress due to medical bills and forego needed care because of costs. Pay-for-performance programs have failed to achieve the results promised and in some cases have backfired. Health care firms expend huge amounts on marketing that provides no benefit to patients. Millions of health care workers, particularly women of color, are so poorly paid that they live in poverty, and gender-based pay inequities remain common in the health sector. Polls continue to show strong popular support for a single-payer reform, but politicians continue to resist it.', 'Objectives: This article outlines the budgetary setting within the UK health-care system. Methods: it is argued that while prospective budgets can give rise to efficient resource allocation outcomes, this relies on the budget being set at an appropriate level and the accompanying incentive structures being efficient. The organizational structures and the interrelationships are critical. The recent history of UK National Health Service reforms and expenditure is outlined. It is suggested that until recently, although the budget system has the potential to promote efficiency, the aggregate budget allocated to the NHS has probably been too low given public expectations, technology advances, and preferences for health care. Results: The aggregate budget is due to rise considerably over the next 5 years. While some incentive and regulatory provisions will move the budget toward an efficient allocation many microlevel incentive issues remain. Conclusion: Whether efficient patterns of health-care allocation emerge remains open to debate, however, because the existing incentive mechanisms are not optimal.', \"Objective To evaluate the impact of Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO) on health care access for adults with disabilities (AWDs). Data Sources Mandatory and voluntary enrollment data for AWDs in Medicaid MCOs in each county were merged with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Area Resource File for 1996-2004. Study Design I use logit regression and two evaluation perspectives to compare access and preventive care for AWDs in Medicaid MCOs with FFS. From the state's perspective, I compare AWDs in counties with mandatory, voluntary, and no MCOs. From the enrollee's perspective, I compare AWDs who must enroll in an MCO or FFS to those who may choose between them. Principal Findings Mandatory MCO enrollees are 24.9 percent more likely to wait > 30 minutes to see a provider, 32 percent more likely to report a problem accessing a specialist, and 10 percent less likely to receive a flu shot within the past year. These differences persist from the state evaluation perspective. Conclusions States should not expect a dramatic change in health care access when they implement Medicaid MCOs to deliver care to the adult disabled population. However, continued attention to specialty care access is warranted for mandatory MCO enrollees.\", \"Background: The effectiveness of a collaborative model of mental health treatment under conditions of routine care in a primary care setting has received limited evaluation. Potential effects include reduced symptoms and decreased healthcare utilization. Methods: The present study describes treatment outcome for 234 patients seen by a mental health professional in a primary care clinic using a collaborative model of care. Patients were seen for one session (n = 120), two sessions (n = 59), three sessions (n = 29), or four or more sessions (n = 26). Patients completed the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) at every session. Results: OQ-45 total scores for patients seen for more than one appointment showed statistically significant reductions in psychological distress from first to last session for all groups. Pre-treatment health care utilization was unrelated to level of psychological distress at the first session. A comparison of health care utilization for the six month period before and after the first session showed a small but statistically significant increase in total number of medical visits. Conclusions: The results support the effectiveness of a collaborative model of mental health care for reducing symptoms in patients seen in a primary care setting. Patient's overall healthcare utilization in the short term was largely unaffected.\", 'Rationale, aims, and objectives The health care delivery model in the United States does not work; it perpetuates unequal access to care, favours treatment over prevention, and contributes to persistent health disparities and lack of insurance. The vast majority of those who suffer from preventable diseases and health disparities, and who are at greatest risk of not having insurance, are low-income minorities (Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-Americans) who live in high risk and vulnerable communities. The historical lack of support in the United States for Universal Health Care (UHC) and Primary Health Care (PHC)-with their emphasis on health care for all, population health, and social determinants of health-requires community health scientists to develop innovative local solutions for addressing unmet community health needs. Methods We developed a model community health science approach for improving health in fragile communities, by combining community-oriented primary care (COPC), community-based participatory research (CBPR), asset-based community development, and service learning principles. During the past two decades, our team has collaborated with community residents, local leaders, and many different types of organizations, to address the health needs of vulnerable patients. The approach defines health as a social outcome, resulting from a combination of clinical science, collective responsibility, and informed social action. Results From 2000 to 2020, we established a federally funded research programme for testing interventions to improve health outcomes in vulnerable communities, by working in partnership with community organizations and other stakeholders. The partnership goals were reducing chronic disease risk and multimorbidity, by stimulating lifestyle changes, increasing healthy behaviours and health knowledge, improving care seeking and patient self-management, and addressing the social determinants of health and population health. Our programmes have also provided structured community health science training in high-risk communities for hundreds of doctors in training. Conclusion Our community health science approach demonstrates that the factors contributing to health can only be addressed by working directly with and in affected communities to co-develop health care solutions across the broad range of causal factors. As the United States begins to consider expanding health care options consistent with PHC and UHC principles, our community health science experience provides useful lessons in how to engage communities to address the deficits of the current system. Perhaps the greatest assets US health care systems have for better addressing population health and the social determinants of health are the important health-related initiatives already underway in most local communities. Building partnerships based on local resources and ongoing social determinants of health initiatives is the key for medicine to meaningfully engage communities for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities. This has been the greatest lesson we have learned the past two decades, has provided the foundation for our community health science approach, and accounts for whatever success we have achieved.', \"The health care system constitutes the organisational framework in which health care delivery takes place. The system and its reforms, therefore, have to reckon with the typical aspects of care delivery and medical practice. Medicine is not the application of medical scientific knowledge but can better be understood as a 'professional practice'. `Practice' is understood as a complex and coherent form of socially established cooperative human activity directed at the realisation of the destination inherent to that practice. The destination of medical practice is to provide adequate medical carl to a person in need because of health problems. This means that medical practice is ethically qualified. The destination of medical practice can be realised by competent performance of the practice, which means that the rules that constitute, i.e. define and limit, that practice are observed. These rules are predominantly of a 'knowing how' kind (tacit knowledge). Health care systems and health care reforms should respect this character of medical practice. The way in which health care expenses are financed, in other words, the health insurance system, forms part of the health care system and can only be evaluated in the latter's context. In order to define positive and negative aspects of health care systems and insurance systems we describe three ideal- type health care systems, the guild-free-choice system, the centrally planned health service and managed competition. Existing systems can be understood as one of these systems, often with elements of the other(s). The combination of this systems analysis and our normative view of medical practice provides us with normative guidelines for the organisation of health care and for the function of health insurance as part of it.\", \"The aim of this paper was to implement and evaluate health promoting palliative care projects through partnerships formed within local communities in the Hume Region, Victoria, Australia. Health promoting palliative care is a public health approach to palliative care developed by Kellehear (1999). This article reports on a project in which the Hume Regional Palliative Care Service in Victoria, Australia sought to implement the approach through partnerships formed with a range of community groups and service agencies in their region. Funding was provided over a two-year period by the 'Caring Communities Program' of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. It was hoped that the project overall would increase community capacity to participate in the care of members of the community living with dying and loss. The project developed implementation strategies and health promotion project guidelines, as outlined below. During the two-year period the palliative care service entered in a number Of new partnerships with community groups and other health services. At first much of the initiative in forming these partnerships came from the palliative care service, but as the project progressed the initiative came increasingly from community partners.\", 'Health care transitions (HCT) from pediatric to adult health care remain a challenge for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), their families and their clinicians. While the HCT literature has expanded, gaps remain in how to improve health outcomes during transitions. HCTs broadly encompass three key domain areas: transition planning, transfer to adult health care clinicians or an adult model of care, and integration into an adult care/model of care. The CYSHCNet national research agenda development process, described in a previous article, prioritized several key research areas to address deficiencies in the HCT process. The highest priority questions identified were What are the best models to accomplish youth-adult transition planning? How might this translate to other transitions (eg, to new clinicians, new settings, new schools, etc.)? and How do gaps in insurance and community supports during early adulthood effect CYSHCN health outcomes, and how can they be reduced?. Based upon these priorities, we describe the current state of transition research and recommendations for future investigation. Recommendations: The authors recommend 3 primary areas of investigation: 1) Understanding the optimal development and implementation of HCT service models in partnership with youth and families to improve transition readiness and transfer 2) Defining the process and outcome measures that capture adequacy of transition-related activities and 3) Evaluating fiscal policies that incentivize the processes of transition readiness development, transfer to adult health care services, and continuity of care within an adult health care setting. This article explores approaches within each research domain.', \"BackgroundIn January 2010, the choice reform was instituted in Swedish primary health care establishing free entry for private primary health care providers and enabling patients to choose freely among primary health care centers. The motivation behind the reform was to improve access to primary care and responsiveness to patient expectations. Reform effects on health care utilization have previously been investigated by using subgroup analyses assuming a pattern of homogeneous subgroups of the population. By using a different methodological approach, the aim of this study was to, from an equity perspective, investigate long term trends of primary health care utilization following the choice reform.MethodA closed cohort was created based on register data from Region Skane, the third most populated region in Sweden, describing individuals' health care utilization between 2007-2017. Using a novel approach, utilization data, measured as primary health care visits, was matched with socioeconomic and geographic determinants, and analyzed using logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 659,298 individuals were included in the cohort. Sex differences in utilization were recorded to decrease in the older age group and to increase in the younger age group. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing utilization in older men to be associated with higher socioeconomic position, while in women it was associated with lower socioeconomic position. Furthermore, groups of becoming high utilizers were all associated with lower socioeconomic position and with residence in urban areas.ConclusionThe impact of demographic, socioeconomic and geographic determinants on primary health care utilization varies in magnitude and direction between groups of the population. As a result, the increase in utilization as observed in the general population following the choice reform is unevenly distributed between different population groups.\", \"In cancer care, communication and coordination across the cancer continuum is paramount for delivering effective, high-quality, patient-centered care. However, achieving optimally coordinated cancer care is inherently challenging, especially in the case of Veterans Administration (VA) care for women's reproductive health cancers. Given the relatively small number of women Veterans requiring care for reproductive malignancies, VA often must rely on community providers to deliver this care, necessitating coordination across two or more health care systems. Recently, VA has invested heavily in improving care for women Veterans through several initiatives and efforts. This article reviews VA's successes, challenges, and future opportunities in research and innovation in the context of care coordination across the cancer continuum (i.e., prevention and screening, diagnosis and treatment, survivorship care, palliative and supportive care) for women Veterans with reproductive health malignancies. We describe how coordination of VA care for reproductive health malignancies currently reflects a mix of successes that demonstrate use of strong evidenced-based practices and challenges, with solutions yet to be fully developed and implemented. We conclude that there are a multitude of opportunities for future research, interventions, and potential avenues for implementing innovative approaches to coordinate VA reproductive cancer care across the cancer continuum.\", 'Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death and important driver of health care costs. Recent German health care reforms have promoted integrated care contracts allowing statutory health insurance providers more room to organize health care provision. One,provider offers KardioPro, an integrated primary care-based CHD prevention program. As insurance providers should be aware of the financial consequences when developing optional programs, this study aims to analyze the costs associated with KardioPro participation. 13,264 KardioPro participants were compared with a propensity score-matched control group. Post-enrollment health care costs were calculated based on routine data over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. For those people who incurred costs, KardioPro participation was significantly associated with increased physician costs (by 33%), reduced hospital costs (by 19%), and reduced pharmaceutical costs (by 16%). Overall costs were increased by 4%, but this was not significant. Total excess costs per observation year were (sic)131 per person (95% confidence interval: [(sic)-36.5; (sic)296]). Overall, KardioPro likely affected treatment as the program increased costs of physician services and reduced costs of hospital services. Further effects of substituting potential inpatient care with increased outpatient care might become fully apparent only over a longer time horizon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The two concepts developed quite differently however. The concept of self care did not attain the same level of legitimacy and stability as health promotion, which has evolved from an alternative approach to the dominance of traditional disease prevention into a rapidly developing health field. The emergence of the concept of self care and the reasons for its relative lack of acceptance are discussed. It is concluded that the concept of self care is logically allied with the field of health promotion and serves an important function in optimizing health related behavior.', 'China has gone through a comprehensive health care insurance reform since 2003 and achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011. The new health care insurance system provides China with a huge opportunity for the development of health care and medical research when its rich medical resources are fully unfolded. In this study, we review the Chinese health care system and its implication for medical research, especially within clinical epidemiology. First, we briefly review the population register system, the distribution of the urban and rural population in China, and the development of the Chinese health care system after 1949. In the following sections, we describe the current Chinese health care delivery system and the current health insurance system. We then focus on the construction of the Chinese health information system as well as several existing registers and research projects on health data. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of the health care system in regard to clinical epidemiology research. China now has three main insurance schemes. The Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) covers urban employees and retired employees. The Urban Residence Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) covers urban residents, including children, students, elderly people without previous employment, and unemployed people. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) covers rural residents. The Chinese Government has made efforts to build up health information data, including electronic medical records. The establishment of universal health care insurance with linkage to medical records will provide potentially huge research opportunities in the future. However, constructing a complete register system at a nationwide level is challenging. In the future, China will demand increased capacity of researchers and data managers, in particular within clinical epidemiology, to explore the rich resources.', \"Aim To describe parental perceptions of general health, oral health and received dental health care in Swedish children with Down syndrome (DS). Methods Online questionnaire, quantitative data analysis (Chi-square test). Results Parents of 101 children with DS (52 boys, 49 girls, mean age: 9.6 years) participated. Seventy percent rated their child's general health and 74% their child's oral health as good or very good. Parents, who rated their child's oral health as poor (8%), also reported that dental procedures were difficult. Children received dental care at general (55%) and specialist clinics (53%). Ninety-four percent of parents of children receiving specialist dental health care were satisfied compared to 70% of parents with children in general clinics. The parents most valued characteristics of dental professionals were patience (63%) and their ability to engage the child (68%). Parents wanted multidisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion Most parents rated their child's general and oral health as good or very good. Children with poor oral health were also reported to have difficulties coping with dental procedures. Parents wanted dental care to be tailored to meet their child's unique needs. They wanted dental professionals to have knowledge about children with a need for special care. Lastly, they requested multidisciplinary collaboration.\", \"Progress to address health care equity requires health care providers' commitment, but their engagement may depend on their perceptions of the factors contributing to inequity. To understand providers' perceptions of causes of racial health care disparities, a short survey was delivered to health care providers who work at 3 Veterans Health Administration sites, followed by qualitative interviews (N = 53). Survey data indicated that providers attributed the causes of disparities to social and economic conditions more than to patients' or providers' behaviors. Qualitative analysis revealed differences in the meaning that participants ascribed to these causal factors. Participants who believed providers contribute to disparities discussed race and racism more readily, identified the mechanisms through which disparities emerge, and contextualized patient-level factors more than those who believed providers contributed less to disparities. Differences in provider understanding of the underlying causal factors suggest a multidimensional approach to engage providers in health equity efforts.\", \"Over the last decade, health literacy has become a vibrant area of research. Our objective was to evaluate health literacy and its association with socio-demographic variables, self-perception of health and the presence of chronic conditions in primary health-care patients. A cross-sectional study among 120 patients was conducted in two primary health-care centers. The test of functional health literacy in adults, a 50-item reading comprehension and 17-item numerical ability test (score, 0-100) were administered. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were applied. Inadequate and marginal health literacy existed in 43 participants (41.0%), and adequate health literacy was present in 62 participants (59.0%). Functional health literacy was significantly different by location, gender, age, marital status, employment, education, material status, self-perception of health and presence of chronic conditions. Based on the multivariate analysis, health literacy was significantly associated with the participant's age (odds ratio [OR], 4.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.41-9.80; P = 0.000), level of education (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.73-11.57; P = 0.002) and chronic conditions (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.16-3.11; P = 0.010). These results provide evidence that limitations in functional health literacy are widespread among primary health-care patients and encourage efforts for further monitoring. Low health literacy may impair a patient's understanding of health messages and limit their ability to attend to their medical problems.\", 'Health care reform has become a global phenomenon. Countries are experiencing similar problems with their health care systems and are reaching for similar solutions. Management is seen as crucial in many countries as the principal means of securing supply-side reforms. Many of these centre on establishing a new relationship between professionals, notably the medical profession, and the state. The aim has been to exercise greater influence over how professionals practice and use resources. The application of new public management principles based on industrial sector practices and concepts of management has created tensions within professional groups who feel themselves, and their craft, to be under attack. But the new managerialism has to be seen within a context of rapid social and economic change. It is not possible to predict what the impact of such change is likely to be on health services in the future or on those who provide them. The paper offers an overview of health care reforms and assesses how it is shaping, or re-shaping, the roles and tasks of health care personnel. One conclusion is the mismatch between the management style favoured by policy-makers and reformers and the necessary flexibility required in skill mix and organization of work. High-trust relations lie at the heart of professional forms of organisation whereas the new managerialism appears to be based on the expectation of low-trust relations. The paper concludes with a brief look at the implications of all these developments for training and education and finds that there is still a long way to go before there is any real prospect of providing and equipping health care personnel with the requisite skills to enable them to meet the complex challenges that are a common characteristic of health care systems.

The program was designed with the belief that dedicated team member time, senior leadership engagement, deliberate project/team selection, and robust, tailored project support would enable rapid and transformative health care redesign. Three teams were supported in the initial 1-year funding cycle; all 3 teams successfully designed, implemented, and tested new care models for different serious illness populations. Results demonstrated improved satisfaction, decreased length of stay, and a positive return on investment. Critical evaluation of current structures and processes will help identify refined strategies to support diverse teams that will challenge the norms of health care delivery and explore novel partnerships, approaches, and settings for care delivery.

They cannot communicate by spoken language and need around the clock support. The health care for people with PIMD is typically provided by a number of different health care services in collaboration with residential care staff and their managers. The quality of health care for people with PIMD are important due to their limited ability to communicate their needs. The aim of this study was to explore residential care staff and manager's experiences and views of health care services for adults with PIMD. Methods Thirteen semi-structured interviews with residential care staff (n = 7) and managers (n = 6) were conducted and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results The informants expressed a variety of experiences, under the theme was Quality of health care is enhanced through residential care staff. The theme was comprised of four subthemes: (1) Individually tailored support promotes quality, (2) Accessibility requires adaptation and prioritization by healthcare providers, (3) Disability competence promotes quality and safety and (4) Complex collaboration conditions between the person with PIMD, residential care staff and disability health care. Conclusions The residential care staff create quality of care in their role as representatives for adults with PIMD. The care situation is complex and requires adequate competence in the disability, the individual's needs and adaptations to ensure quality of health care. It is also important to build collaboration with other services that are involved in the care of people with PIMD.\", \"As the health care system moves in a new direction, toward managed care, the critical role of public health in society's efforts to mitigate illness and the realization of health become more apparent. Indeed, the public health problems of this era will not yield to simple solutions. They require a multitude of resources, both human and material, and a myriad of services derived from these resources. Public health's role is to serve as the government's presence in assessing health status, developing policy, evaluating the effectiveness of policy implementation, and assuring access to and quality of comprehensive health services. Increasingly, public health must coordinate a wide array of systems in both the private and public sectors to fulfill its purpose.\", \"Background: While research on individual health literacy is steadily increasing, less attention has been paid to the context of care that may help to increase the patient's ability to navigate health care or to compensate for their limited health literacy. In 2012, Brach et al. introduced the concept of health literate health care organizations (HLHOs) to describe the organizational context of care. This paper presents our effort in developing and validating an HLHO instrument. Method: Ten items were developed to represent the ten attributes of HLHO (HLHO-10) based on a literature review, an expert workshop, a focus group discussion, and qualitative interviews. The instrument was applied in a key informant survey in 51 German hospitals as part of a larger study on patient information and training needs (PIAT-study). Item properties were analyzed and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the instrument's unidimensionality. To investigate the instrument's predictive validity, a multilevel analysis was performed that used the HLHO-10 score to predict the adequacy of information provided to 1,224 newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients treated at the sample hospitals. Results: Cronbach's a of the resulting scale was 0.89. CFA verified the one-factor structure after allowing for the correlation for four pairs of error terms. In the multilevel model, HLHO-10 significantly predicted the adequacy of information as perceived by patients. Conclusion: The instrument has satisfactory reliability and validity. It provides a useful tool to assess the degree to which health care organizations help patients to navigate, understand, and use information and services. Further validation should include participant observation in health care organizations and a sample that is not limited to breast cancer care.\", \"Health care organizations increasingly recognize the impact of social needs on health outcomes. As organizations develop and scale efforts to address social needs, little is known about the optimal role for clinicians in providing social care. In this study, the authors aimed to understand how health care organizations involve clinicians in formal social care efforts. In 2019, the authors conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with administrators at 29 health care organizations. Interviews focused on the development and implementation of formal social care programs within the health care organization and the role of clinicians within those programs. A few administrators described formal roles for primary care clinicians in organizational efforts to deliver social care. Administrators frequently described programs that were deliberately structured to shield clinicians (eg, clinicians were not expected to review social risk screening results or be involved in addressing social needs). The authors identified 4 ways that administrators felt clinicians could meaningfully engage in social care programs: (1) discuss social risks to strengthen relationships with patients; (2) adjust clinical care follow-up plans based on social risks; (3) modify prescriptions based on social risks; and (4) refer patients to other care team members who can directly assist with social risks. Administrators were hesitant to increase primary care clinicians' responsibilities by tasking them with social care activities. Defining appropriate and scalable roles for clinicians along with adequate support from other care team members may increase the effectiveness of social care programs.\", 'Primary health care in Australia has undergone 2 decades of change. Starting with a vision for a national health strategy with general practice at its core, Australia established local meso-level primary health care organizations-Divisions of General Practice-moving from focus on individual practitioners to a professional collective local voice. The article identifies how these meso-level organizations have helped the Australian primary health care system evolve by supporting the roll-out of initiatives including national practice accreditation, a focus on quality improvement, expansion of multidisciplinary teams into general practice, regional integration, information technology adoption, and improved access to care. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to ensuring equitable access and the supply and distribution of a primary care workforce, addressing the increasing rates of chronic disease and obesity, and overcoming the fragmentation of funding and accountability in the Australian system.

Despite major advances in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer, health care ministries face multitiered challenges to create and support health care programs that can improve breast cancer outcomes. In addition to the financial and organizational problems inherent in any health care system, breast health programs are hindered by a lack of recognition of cancer as a public health priority, trained health care personnel shortages and migration, public and health care provider educational deficits, and social barriers that impede patient entry into early detection and cancer treatment programs. No perfect health care system exists, even in the wealthiest countries. Based on inevitable economic and practical constraints, all health care systems are compelled to make trade-offs among four factors: access to care, scope of service, quality of care, and cost containment. Given these trade-offs, guidelines can define stratified approaches by which economically realistic incremental improvements can be sequentially implemented within the context of resource constraints to improve breast health care. Disease-specific vertical programs warrant horizontal integration with existing health care systems in limited-resource countries. The Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) Health Care Systems and Public Policy Panel defined a stratified framework outlining recommended breast health care interventions for each of four incremental levels of resources (basic, limited, enhanced, and maximal). Reallocation of existing resources and integration of a breast health care program with existing programs and infrastructure can potentially improve outcomes in a cost-sensitive manner. This adaptable framework can be used as a tool by policymakers for program planning and research design to make best use of available resources to improve breast health care in a given limited resource setting.', 'This paper presents a detailed description of health care resource utilisation and costs of a pilot interdisciplinary health care model of palliative home care in Ontario, Canada. The descriptive evaluation entailed examining the use of services and costs of the pilot program: patient demographics, length of stay broken down by disposition (discharged, alive, death), access to services/resources, use of family physician and specialist services, and drug use. There were 434 patients included in the pilot program. Total costs were approximately CAN$2.4 million, and the cost per person amounted to approximately CAN$5586.33 with average length of stay equal to over 2 months (64.22 days). One may assume that length of stay would be influenced by the amount of service and support available. Future research might investigate whether in-home palliative home care is the most cost effective and suitable care setting for those patients requiring home care services for expected periods of time.

The authors examined the relationship between receipt of routine medical care and receipt of dental care among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who resided in the American Dental Association's Fifth Trustee District, which includes Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Methods. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2001 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a module of that year's State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Maternal and-Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Service Administration, Rockville, Md., and conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta). The authors used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to explore the relationships (n = 2,092) between predisposing, enabling and need factors and receipt of dental care. Results. The parents of an estimated 76 percent of CSHCN in the district reported that their child had a need-for dental care in the previous 12 months. Of these, 13.1 percent did not receive care. Failure to obtain needed dental care was associated with failure to obtain routine medical care, as was having a lower income. Conclusions. Failure to obtain routine medical care may be a risk factor for failure to obtain dental care. Any income below 400 percent of the federal poverty guidelines appears to be a barrier to receiving dental care for CSHCN. Practice Implications: Providers of routine medical care may play an important role in linking CSHCN to dental care. Investigators need to examine other barriers to dental care for CSHCN. Strategies to optimize access to dental care for CSHCN at all income levels are needed.\", 'The relationship between health care expenditure and health outcomes has been the subject of recent academic inquiry in order to inform cost-effectiveness thresholds for health technology assessment agencies. Previous studies in public health systems have relied upon data aggregated at the national or regional level; however, there remains debate about whether the supply side effect of changes to expenditure are identifiable using data at this level of aggregation. We use detailed patient data derived from electronic neonatal records across England along with routinely available cost data to estimate the effect of changes to patient expenditure on clinical health outcomes in a well-defined patient population. A panel of 32 neonatal intensive care units for the period 2009-2013 was constructed. Accounting for the potential endogeneity of expenditure a 100 pound increase in the cost per intensive care cot day (sample average cost: 1,127) pound is estimated to reduce the risk of mortality of 0.38 percentage points (sample average mortality: 11.0%) in neonatal intensive care. This translates into a cost per life saved in neonatal intensive care of approximately 420,000 pound.', \"Background Trans and gender-diverse people face multiple barriers within health care.

Method Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were generated using semi-structured qualitative interviews. A thematic analysis involved coding and categorising data using NVivo (version 12) software and further conceptual analysis in which developing themes were identified. Results Four barrier domains to good-quality care for trans and gender-diverse people were identified: structural (related to lack of guidelines, long waiting times, and shortage of specialist centres); educational (based on lack of training on trans health); cultural and social (reflecting negative attitudes towards trans people); and technical (related to information systems and technology). Conclusion There is an urgent need to address the barriers trans and gender-diverse people face in health care. Structural-level solutions include health policy, professional education, and standards; at the practice level, GPs can act as potential drivers of change in addressing the cultural and technical barriers to better meet the needs of their trans and gender-diverse patients.\", 'Objective: To estimate the average incremental health care expenditures associated with habitual long and short duration of sleep as compared with healthy/average sleep duration. Data Source: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2012; N=6476) linked to the 2010-2011 National Health Interview Survey. Study Design: Annual differences in health care expenditures are estimated for habitual long and short duration sleepers as compared with average duration sleepers using 2-part logit generalized linear regression models. Principal Findings: Habitual short duration sleepers reported an additional $1400 in total unadjusted health care expenditures compared to people with average sleep duration (P<0.01). After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and health behavior factors, this difference remained significant with an additional $1278 in total health care expenditures over average duration sleepers (P<0.05). Long duration sleepers reported even higher, $2994 additional health care expenditures over average duration sleepers. This difference in health care expenditures remained significantly high ($1500,P<0.01) in the adjusted model. Expenditure differences are more pronounced for inpatient hospitalization, office expenses, prescription expenses, and home health care expenditures. Conclusions: Habitual short and long sleep duration is associated with higher health care expenditures, which is consistent with the association between unhealthy sleep duration and poorer health outcomes.', 'The objective of this concept analysis was to formulate an operational definition, so that those seeking, providing, and legislating health care policy would share a common interpretation of the concept. A concept analysis following the strategy suggested by Walker and Avant was used to identify antecedents, attributes, and empirical referents of access to health care. Furthermore, model, borderline, contrary, and invented cases were described. A theoretical definition was derived, which will lead to a better understanding of the concept and bring the concept closer to measurability and readiness for an operational definition. Access to health care has been addressed in political campaigns, studied by numerous legislative committees, and purported to be in an emergency state of disrepair. However, a measurable definition of access to health care continues to elude providers and legislators of health care; in as much, the meaning of the concept varies with the user.', 'This article explores legislative provisions in relation to patient privacy in the context of integrated health and social care and the development of multidisciplinary health care teams that include practitioners from private sector and government agencies in the health, education, child protection, family welfare, disability, aged-care, housing, local government and criminal justice sectors. The definition of a multidisciplinary health care team and the extent to which health information can be shared within the team is examined. Australian Commonwealth and State legislation provides for the sharing within a health care team of health information where that is for the primary purpose it was collected, and for a secondary purpose where that is directly related to the primary purpose, or might be reasonably expected by the patient for the provision of their care. For this purpose consent is not required.', 'The authors of ???Integration or Fragmentation of Health Care? Examining Policies and Politics in a Belgian Case Study??? present a fresh perspective on the inertia of integrated care (IC) implementation. They conclude that the decisive power in Belgium is fragmented and undermines efforts towards IC. As researchers in integrated heart failure care and active primary health care professionals, we comment on the three policy initiatives evaluated by Martens et al from a bottom-up perspective. A Learning Health Care Network (LHCN) was established Sept 2019 to overcome fragmentation, the lack of evaluation and capacity loss each time a pilot project ends. This commentary wishes to illustrate that a LHCN can be a powerful meso-level mechanism to engage in alignment work and to overcome macro-level barriers that are often difficult to change and not supportive of IC.', 'Advance care planning and symptom management (supportive cancer care) improves patient experiences and reduces acute care use (hospitalizations and emergency department visits). Strong evidence supports team-based approaches to deliver supportive cancer care. However no studies, to our knowledge, have evaluated the use of lay or community health workers to deliver supportive cancer care as compared to usual cancer care. The Health Care Coach Support intervention was developed to improve cancer care. The intervention assigns a lay or community health worker health coach to all patients newly diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer or patients with recurrent or progressive disease. The intervention aims to educate and activate patients in advance care planning discussions and symptom management with their clinicians. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the 12-month health coach intervention combined with usual oncology care or usual oncology care alone. The primary outcome is to evaluate whether the intervention reduces acute care use measured at 6-months follow-up more than usual care. Secondary outcomes include the effect on acute care, palliative care, and hospice at 12-months follow-up and one month prior to death for patients who die. Additional secondary outcomes include changes in patient satisfaction with decision and patient satisfaction with care from baseline (time of enrollment) to 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-enrollment. The Health Coach Support study addresses an important gap in supportive cancer care by testing whether a team-based approach using non-professional personnel can ensure delivery of these services. Findings can assist in our understanding of how to improve care for patients with cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration #NCT03154190', \"Objectives: Our two study objectives were: (1) to understand the relationship between the perception of a previous negative health-care experience and race/ethnicity, and how socio-demographic, access-to-health-care, and self-reported health variables modified this relationship; and (2) to assess how many behaviors participants reported changing as a result of experiencing a perceived negative health-care experience, which behaviors they changed, and if there were differences in patterns of change across racial/ethnic groups. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 600 African-American, Mexican-Hispanic, and white adults in socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods in Chicago, IL. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the relationship between a perceived negative health-care experience in the last 5 years and race/ethnicity. We summed and then calculated the percentage of people who changed each of the 10 behaviors and evaluated whether or not there were differences in behavior change across racial/ethnic groups. Principal findings: More than 32% of participants reported a perceived negative health-care experience in the past 5 years. Participants who had a bachelor's degree or above (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.01-8.63), avoided needed care due to cost (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11-3.06), or who reported fair/poor health (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.66-7.80) had significantly increased odds of reporting a negative health-care experience. Of these people, 88% reported 'sometimes/always' changing at least one health-seeking behavior. There were no racial/ethnic differences in reporting negative experiences or in patterns of behavior change. Conclusions: Race/ethnicity was not related to reporting a perceived negative health-care experience or reported patterns of behavior change in response to that experience. However, those who avoided care due to cost were more highly educated, or who indicated poorer health status reported having a negative experience more often. Our findings suggest that the perception of a previous negative experience may influence subsequent health-care-seeking behaviors.\", \"BACKGROUND: The influence of prior patterns of health care utilization on future health care utilization has had minimal investigation in populations with musculoskeletal disorders. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between presurgical health care utilization and postsurgical health care utilization in a population of patients undergoing hip surgery in the US Military Health System. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, person-level data were collected for patients undergoing hip arthroscopy in the Military Health System from 2003 to 2015, capturing all encounters 12 months before and 24 months after surgery for every individual. Cluster analysis was used to categorize individuals with high and low health care utilization, based on preoperative health care visits. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson and generalized linear models were generated. Health care utilization outcomes were targeted, including costs, visits, and medication use. RESULTS: There were 1850 individuals in the final cohort (mean age, 32.18 years; 55.4% male). The high health care utilization group averaged 57.69 +/- 25.87 visits, compared to 20.43 +/- 8.36 visits in the low utilization group. There were significant differences between groups for total health care visits (58.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.39, 58.58), total health care costs ($11 539.71; 95% CI: $10 557.26, $12 595.04), hip-related visits (12.77; 95% CI: 12.59, 12.96), hip-related costs ($3325.07; 95% CI: $2886.43, $3804.51), days' supply of pain medications (752.67; 95% CI: 751.24, 754.11), opioid prescriptions (48.83; 95% CI: 48.47, 49.21), and cost of pain medications ($1074.80; 95% CI: $1011.91, $1137.68). CONCLUSION: Presurgical patterns of health care utilization were associated with postsurgical patterns of health care utilization, indicating that those patients who used more care before surgery also used more care after surgery. Clinicians should consider prior patterns of health care utilization, including utilization unrelated to the index condition, when determining care plans and prognosis.\", \"The aim of this study was to examine the procedures of primary dental health care performed by oral health teams (OHTs) adhering to the second cycle of the 'National Programme for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care' (PMAQ-AB) in Brazil. A cross-sectional descriptive analysis was performed, across 23 dental procedures comprising preventive, restorative/prosthetic, surgical, endodontic and oral cancer monitoring. Descriptive analysis shows that most of the oral health teams carry out basic dental procedures. However, most of the time, they do not keep adequate records of suspected cases of oral cancer, diagnosis tests or follow-ups, and do not perform dental prosthetic procedures. Data also showed disparities in the average number of procedures performed in each Brazilian geographical region in 2013-2014, ranging from 13.9 in the northern to 16.5 in the southern and south-eastern regions, reinforcing the great social disparities between them. Brazilian regions with the highest volume of dental need deliver the lowest number of dental procedures. The need to tackle inequalities and further shape the supply of appropriate primary health care (PHC) is evident.\", 'Background Having a sufficient and well-functioning health workforce is crucial for reducing the burden of disease and premature death. Health workforce development, focusing on availability, recruitment, retention, and education, is inseparable from acceptability, motivation, burnout, role and responsibility, and performance. Each aspect of workforce development may face several challenges, requiring specific strategies. However, there was little evidence on barriers and strategies towards comprehensive health workforce development. Therefore, this review explored barriers and strategies for health workforce development at the primary health care level around the world.Methods A scoping review of reviews was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. The article search was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. We used EndNote x9 for managing the collected articles, screening processes, and citation purpose. The scoping review included any kind of review articles on the application of health workforce development concepts, such as availability, recruitment, retention, role and responsibility, education and training, motivation, and burnout, with primary health care and published in English anywhere in the world. Based on the concepts above, barriers and strategies for health workforce development were identified. The findings were synthesized qualitatively based on the building blocks of the health system framework. The analysis involved specific activities such as familiarization, construction of the thematic framework, indexing, charting, and interpretation. The results were presented in texts, tables, and figures.Results The search strategies yielded 7,276 papers were found. Of which, 69 were included in the scoping review. The most frequently cited barriers were financial challenges and issues related to health care delivery, such as workloads. Barriers affecting healthcare providers directly, including lack of training and ineffective teamwork, were also prominent. Other health system and governance barriers include lack of support, unclear responsibility, and inequity. Another notable barrier was the shortage of health care technology, which pertains to both health care supplies and information technology. The most common cited effective strategies were ongoing support and supervision, engaging with communities, establishing appropriate primary care settings, financial incentives, fostering teamwork, and promoting autonomous health care practice.Conclusions Effective leadership/governance, a robust health financing system, integration of health information and technology, such as mobile health and ensuring a consistent supply of adequate resources are also vital components of primary health care workforce development. The findings highlight the importance of continuous professional development, which includes training new cadres, implementing effective recruitment and retention mechanisms, optimising the skill mix, and promoting workplace wellness. These elements are essential in fostering a well-trained and resilient primary health care workforce.', 'The accountable care organization (ACO) provides an opportunity to strategically design a comprehensive health system in which oral health works within primary care. A dental hygienist/therapist within the ACO represents value-based health care in action. Background Inspired by health care reform efforts in Minnesota, a vision of an accountable care organization that integrates oral health into primary health care was developed. Dental hygienists and dental therapists can help accelerate the integration of oral health into primary care, particularly in light of the compelling evidence confirming the cost-effectiveness of care delivered by an allied workforce. Methods A dental insurance Chief Operating Officer and a dental hygiene educator used their unique perspectives and experience to describe the potential of an interdisciplinary team-based approach to individual and population health, including oral health, via an accountable care community. Conclusions The principles of the patient-centered medical home and the vision for accountable care communities present a paradigm shift from a curative system of care to a prevention-based system that encompasses the behavioral, social, nutritional, economic, and environmental factors that impact health and well-being. Oral health measures embedded in the spectrum of general health care have the potential to ensure a truly comprehensive healthcare system.', \"Background: Older persons are often poorly served by existing models of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). We sought input from clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers on recommendations for system improvements. Methods: Focus group interviews were held with clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers in mid-sized urban and rural communities in Ontario. Data were analyzed using a combination of directed and emergent coding. Results were shared with participants during a series of feedback sessions. Results: An extensive list of barriers, facilitators, and recommended health system improvements was generated. Barriers included poor system integration and limited access to services. Identified facilitators were person and family-focused care, self-management resources, and successful collaborative practice. Recommended system improvements included expanding and integrating care teams, supports for system navigation, and development of standardized information systems and care pathways. Conclusions: Older adults still experience frustrating obstacles when trying to access CBPHC. Identified barriers and facilitators of improved system integration aligned well with current literature and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Additional work is needed to implement the recommended improvements and to discern their impact on patient and system outcomes.\", 'This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition under which increased health care productivity must lead to decreased (increased) demand for health care as long as the demand for health care is inelastic (elastic). It is shown that this condition identifies a class of health production functions, which may provide useful guidance to empirical studies that depend wholly or partly on the correct specification of a health production function. As an illustration, it is demonstrated that this class of production functions may be useful for empirical studies that test the hypothesis that schooling, increasing the efficiency of health production, leads to a larger health output from a given set of health inputs. The paper also offers broader classes of production functions that would enable one to test this relationship between the demand elasticity and the effect of health care productivity on health care demand.

To strengthen information systems so that they represent primary health care complexities, participatory meetings were held with primary care practitioners from the public health care system of Buenos Aires City. Terms for the record tool and its components were chosen using consensus methodologies. This process involved 300 practitioners from 49 centers, and submission of 21 proposals. It was decided to change the term Electronic Medical Record with Comprehensive Health Record. It was also agreed that, apart from Reason for Consultation, the field Problem Situation would be added, that Care Service would be replaced with Care Act, and that a new module Health Team Management and Education Activities would be included to document practitioners team activities.', 'The term psychologically informed health care  refers to the comprehensive integration of psychological principles into health care. Psychologically informed health care has the potential to lead to a transformation of care, resulting in truly transdisciplinary care. To facilitate its future development, we discuss key characteristics of this approach. These include the direct mode (psychologists assessing and treating patients themselves) and indirect mode (psychologists working through other health care providers) of integrating psychological principles into healthcare; the range of health domains targeted using this approach; transdisciplinary care, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries; and the positioning of care. We describe a framework for transdisciplinary care, which we refer to as the Framework for Catalytic Collaboration. This framework comprises six dimensions: setting, disciplines, patients/clients, mode of psychological care, primary components of care, and primary targets of care. We also provide four brief illustrations of psychologically informed health care. Finally, we discuss future directions, including the need for professional recognition of the indirect mode, financing of the indirect mode, cross-disciplinary training and trans-disciplinary research.', \"Background: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care providers (PCPs) often see few women, making it challenging to maintain proficiency in women's health (WH). Therefore, VHA in 2010 established Designated WH Providers, who would maintain proficiency in comprehensive WH care and be preferentially assigned women patients. Objective: To evaluate early implementation of this national policy. Methods: At each VHA health care system (N = 140), the Women Veterans Program Manager completed a Fiscal Year 2012 workforce capacity assessment (response rate, 100%), representing the first time the national Designated WH Provider workforce had been identified. Assessment data were linked to administrative data. Results: Of all VHA PCPs, 23% were Designated WH Providers; 100% of health care systems and 83% of community clinics had at least 1 Designated WH Provider. On average, women veterans comprised 19% (SD = 27%) of the patients Designated WH Providers saw in primary care, versus 5% (SD = 7%) for Other PCPs (P < 0.001). For women veterans using primary care (N = 313,033), new patients were less likely to see a Designated WH Provider than established women veteran patients (52% vs. 64%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: VHA has achieved its goal of a Designated WH Provider in every health care system, and is approaching its goal of a Designated WH Provider at every hospital/community clinic. Designated WH Providers see more women than do Other PCPs. However, as the volume of women patients remains low for many providers, attention to alternative approaches to maintaining proficiency may prove necessary, and barriers to assigning new women patients to Designated WH Providers merit attention.\", 'Population health in the United States continues to lag behind other wealthy nations. Primary care has the promise of enhancing population health; however, the implementation of a population health approach within primary care deserves further consideration. Clinicians and staff from a national sample of 10 innovative primary care practices participated in a working conference to reflect upon population health approaches in primary care. A series of small- and large-group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and coded through an immersion/crystallization approach. Two prominent themes emerged: (1) Transitioning to a population health focus generally develops through stages, with early implementation focusing on risk stratification and later, more advanced stages focusing on community health; and (2) Several inherent barriers confront implementation of a population health approach, including tensions with patient-centered care, and limitations of health information technology. A broader conceptualization of population health in terms of community health could more effectively allow partnerships among primary care, large health care systems, public health organizations, patients, and other partners in the community.', \"Introduction: Research on partnerships between parents and health care professionals (HCPs) to improve adolescent health is limited. In this study, we have developed an empirically derived framework to guide research in this particular area. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups and in-depth semi-structured interviews. A total of 85 participants (51 HCPs, 17 mothers of patients of ages 12-18 years, and 17 adolescents) were recruited from three free-standing adolescent health clinics and five school-based health centers across North Carolina. We independently explored the perceptions of HCPs and mothers regarding the roles of parents, HCPs, and parent-HCP partnerships in preventing and addressing adolescent health problems. We then elicited feedback of adolescents on mother and HCP perceptions. We identified common and informative themes during content analysis using ATLAS. ti, and triangulated perspectives of HCPs, mothers, and adolescents to develop a framework for building parent-HCP partnerships to improve adolescent health. Results: A general framework emerged that conceptualizes both direct and indirect strategies for building parent-HCP partnerships. Direct strategies involve strengthening relationships and/or communication between parents and HCPs in both practice and community settings. Indirect strategies involve opportunities for HCPs to influence parent-adolescent relationships and/or communication within the context of adolescent visits. For example, HCPs can discuss the importance of parental involvement and monitoring with adolescents, encourage and facilitate parent-adolescent communication, and deliver tailored parental guidance while also respecting adolescents' desires for confidential health care when appropriate. Conclusions: Interventions that directly strengthen parent-HCP relationships and/or communication, and those that indirectly support parent-HCP partnerships within the context of adolescent health care, should be designed targeting health outcomes.

Infrastructural deficiencies of health services are reported in literature and research. A number of instruments exist for the assessment of infrastructure. However, no easy-to-use instruments to assess health facility infrastructure in developing countries are available. Present tools are not applicable for a rapid assessment by health facility staff. Therefore, health information systems lack data on facility infrastructure. Methods: A rapid assessment tool for the infrastructure of primary health care facilities was developed by the authors and pilot-tested in Tanzania. The tool measures the quality of all infrastructural components comprehensively and with high standardization. Ratings use a 2-1-0 scheme which is frequently used in Tanzanian health care services. Infrastructural indicators and indices are obtained from the assessment and serve for reporting and tracing of interventions. The tool was pilot-tested in Tanga Region (Tanzania). Results: The pilot test covered seven primary care facilities in the range between dispensary and district hospital. The assessment encompassed the facilities as entities as well as 42 facility buildings and 80 pieces of technical medical equipment. A full assessment of facility infrastructure was undertaken by health care professionals while the rapid assessment was performed by facility staff. Serious infrastructural deficiencies were revealed. The rapid assessment tool proved a reliable instrument of routine data collection by health facility staff. Conclusions: The authors recommend integrating the rapid assessment tool in the health information systems of developing countries. Health authorities in a decentralized health system are thus enabled to detect infrastructural deficiencies and trace the effects of interventions. The tool can lay the data foundation for district facility infrastructure management.', 'Background: Cambodia is a country where the resources for treating mental health disorders are far from sufficient. One strategy to narrow the treatment gap is to integrate mental health into primary health care (PHC). Understanding the knowledge and attitudes towards mental health integration that health-care workers have is important for assessing the challenges and opportunities when planning a potential integration project. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess these basic conditions in Lvea Em District, Cambodia. Design: A structured self-reporting questionnaire regarding attitudes and knowledge about mental health and its integration into PHC was collected from 75 health-care workers in Lvea Em District, Cambodia in October 2015. Firstly, descriptive analyses were carried out, and secondly, linear regression analyses to assess the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic variables were conducted. Results: There was clear support towards integrating mental health services into PHC among these participants as 81.3% were interested in personally delivering mental health care at their units. Respondents who reported having received some kind of mental health-care training tended to have a more positive attitude towards mentally ill people (p = 0.005) and those who thought there was a high need for mental health care had a more favourable attitude towards the integration of mental health services (p = 0.007). Conclusions: The most important finding from this survey was the willingness and the acceptance of the need for integration of mental health care. This enhances the feasibility of integrating mental health services at the PHC level. Improving the competence of mental health care in these settings will likely help to reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in Cambodia.', \"Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is the future that is already here. Despite its potential as a transformational force for primary care, most primary care providers (PCPs) do not know what it is, how it will impact them and their patients, and what its key limitations and ethical pitfalls are. This article is a beginner's guide to health care AI, written for the frontline PCP. Primary care-as the dominant force at the base of the health care pyramid, with its unrivaled interconnectedness to every part of the health system and its deep relationship with patients and communities-is the most uniquely suited specialty to lead the health care AI revolution. PCPs can advance health care AI by partnering with technologists to ensure that AI use cases are relevant and human-centered, applying quality improvement methods to health care AI implementations, and advocating for inclusive and ethical AI that combats, rather than worsens, health inequities.\", 'Background Child care workers play an important role in caring for children attending child care yet there is little research regarding their health. Methods The study consisted of focus groups with child care workers and a survey, conducted as part of a larger study known as the Healthy Child Care Study, which focused on children. The study investigated carers working in formal child care [long day care (LDC) and family day care (FDC)]. Results Questionnaires to caregivers in centres showed that 86% had taken sick leave in the previous year and 75% of staff had taken leave for infectious illness. Carers in FDC reported that 24% had taken sick leave in the previous year and 12% of carers had taken leave for infectious illness. Of responding caregivers from centres, 22% were cigarette smokers while in FDC homes, 8% of carers smoked. In focus groups, carers reported that their major areas of health concern were stress, infectious illness and physical trauma such as lifting injuries. Conclusions Child care workers in LDC took more sick leave than those in FDC but this is not necessarily due to more illness. Child care workers are a diverse and important group that require further research.', \"PURPOSE It has been suggested that the best way to improve chronic illness care is through a redesign of primary care emphasizing comprehensive, coordinated care as espoused by the Chronic Care Model (CCM). This study examined the relationship between primary care orientation and the implementation of the CCM in physician organizations. METHODS The relationship between measures of primary care orientation and the CCM was examined in a sample of 957 physician organizations from the National Study of Physician Organizations, a cross-sectional telephone survey of all US medical groups and independent practice associations with 20 or more physicians (response rate, 70%). RESULTS After adjusting for potential confounders, 6 of 8 measures of primary care orientation were associated with physician organizations' adoption of 11 elements of CCM chronic care management. These 6 measures were severity of chronic illness treated in primary care, health promotion activity, health education activity, any accepted financial risk for hospitalization, required reporting, and presence of an electronic standardized problem list. Presence of an electronic medical record and the 5-year primary care physician turnover rate were not associated. CONCLUSIONS Organizations that have adopted 6 core attributes of primary care, representing comprehensive health service delivery and a commitment to overall patient health, appear to use more chronic care management practices. Policy makers and other stakeholders may wish to focus on creating an improved primary care home in their quest to close the quality chasm in chronic illness care.\", 'Purpose: Transgender veterans are overrepresented in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) compared with in the general population. Utilization of multiple different health care systems, or health care mobility, can affect care coordination and potentially affect outcomes, either positively or negatively. This study examines whether transgender veterans are more or less health care mobile than nontransgender veterans and compares the patterns of geographic mobility in these groups. Methods: Using an established cohort (n = 5,414,109), we identified 2890 transgender veterans from VHA electronic health records from 2000 to 2012. We compared transgender and nontransgender veterans on sociodemographic, clinical, and health care system-level measures and conducted conditional logistic regression models of mobility. Results: Transgender veterans were more likely to be younger, White, homeless, have depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and hepatitis C. Transgender veterans were more likely to have been health care mobile (9.9%) than nontransgender veterans (5.2%) (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.73-2.36). In a multivariable model, transgender status, being separated/divorced, receiving care in less-complex facilities, and diagnoses of depression, PTSD, or hepatitis C were associated with more mobility, whereas older age was associated with less mobility. For the top three health care systems utilized, a larger proportion of transgender veterans visited a second health care system in a different state (56.2%) than nontransgender veterans (37.5%). Conclusions: Transgender veterans were more likely to be health care mobile and more likely to travel out of state for health care services. They were also more likely to have complex chronic health conditions that require multidisciplinary care.', \"Background and Objectives: Few who experience sexual assault seek health care immediately. Yet many become heavy users of health care resources in the years postassault because sexual violence has been linked with both acute and chronic health consequences. Our objective was to investigate servicewomen's medical and mental health (MH) care utilization after sexual assault in-military (SAIM) and identify reasons for not seeking care. Methods: In a retrospective cross-sectional Midwestern community sample of OEF/OIF Active Component and Reserve/National Guard servicewomen, currently serving and veterans, computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 207 servicewomen who experienced SAIM. Results: A quarter (25%) received post-SAIM MH care and 16% medical care. Utilization of medical care tended to be sooner (within the first month) and MH care later (6mo to 1+y). Most sought care on a military base, a third from civilian providers, and 10% sought MH from Veterans Health Administration. Servicewomen were more likely to have utilized medical care if they had experienced a completed SAIM and made a Department of Defense SAIM report and MH care if they were white, experienced on-duty SAIM, and made a Department of Defense SAIM report. The most common reason for not seeking medical care was due to belief that care was not needed. Reasons for not utilizing medical or MH care included embarrassment, confidentiality concerns, and fear of adverse career consequences. Conclusions: Few servicewomen utilized post-SAIM care, thus assault-specific health consequences were likely unaddressed. Given the severe and chronic consequences of sexual assault, our findings emphasize need for military, Veterans Health Administration, and civilian providers to query SAIM history to provide timely and optimal care.\", \"Current trends in health care delivery and management such as predictive and personalized health care incorporating information and communication technologies, home-based care, health prevention and promotion through patients' empowerment, care coordination, community health networks and governance represent exciting possibilities to dramatically improve health care. However, as a whole, current health care trends involve a fragmented and scattered array of practices and uncoordinated pilot projects. The present paper describes an innovative and integrated model incorporating and assembling best practices and projects of new innovations into an overarching health care system that can effectively address the multidimensional health care challenges related to aging patient especially with chronic health issues. The main goal of the proposed model is to address the emerging health care challenges of an aging population and stimulate improved cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and patients' well-being. The proposed home-based and community-centered Integrated Healthcare Management System may facilitate reaching the persons in their natural context, improving early detection, and preventing illnesses. The system allows simplifying the health care institutional structures through interorganizational coordination, increasing inclusiveness and extensiveness of health care delivery. As a consequence of such coordination and integration, future merging efforts of current health care approaches may provide feasible solutions that result in improved cost-efficiency of health care services and simultaneously increase the quality of life, in particular, by switching the center of gravity of health delivery to a close relationship of individuals in their communities, making best use of their personal and social resources, especially effective in health delivery for aging persons with complex chronic illnesses.\", \"Most studies have concluded that good prenatal care plays an essential role in improving birth outcomes, and numerous reports have documented barriers to adequate prenatal care. The relationship between health care insurance eligibility and enrollment procedures and adequacy of prenatal care, however, has not been suitably investigated. This study used data from a statewide representative sample of recently delivered women in South Carolina to assess (1) patterns of health care insurance source and (2) the independent effects of Medicaid enrollment and application procedures on receipt of prenatal care. Health insurance during pregnancy varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Black women's experiences with Medicaid enrollment and application procedures were associated with less than adequate prenatal care. Programmatic efforts and policies should emphasize further improvement in the systems of health care access and delivery to disadvantaged women.\", \"Background/Objectives Medicare-certified home health agencies are required to offer family caregiver training, but little is known regarding the potential impact of this training on outcomes during home health care. We estimate the proportion of family caregivers assisting Medicare home health patients who have unmet training needs and examine whether these unmet training needs are associated with older adults' risk of acute care utilization during home health care. Design Observational, nationally representative cohort study. Setting Linked National Health and Aging Trends Study, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Medicare Provider of Services file, and Medicare claims data from 2011 to 2016. Participants Thousand two hundred seventeen (weighted n = 5,870,905) community-living Medicare beneficiaries who received home health care between 2011 and 2016. Measurements Family caregivers' unmet training needs measured from OASIS and Medicare claims; home health patients' acute care utilization (including emergency department use and hospitalization) measured from OASIS. Results Rates of unmet need for training varied by activity, from 8.2% of family caregivers assisting with household chores to 16.0% assisting with self-care tasks. After controlling for older adult and home health provider characteristics, older adults whose family caregivers had an unmet need for training with any caregiving activity were twice as likely to incur acute care utilization during their home health episode (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-3.38). This relationship held across specific caregiving activities including household chores (aOR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.13-3.46), medication management (aOR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.46-4.26), patient supervision (aOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.36-6.24), and self-care tasks (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.62-6.00). Conclusions and Relevance Unmet training needs among family caregivers are associated with greater likelihood of acute care utilization among Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health care. Identifying and addressing family caregivers' training needs may reduce older adults' risk of acute care utilization during home health care.\", \"Objective: Explore the perceptions of patients and health care professionals about patients' ideas, concerns, expectations (ICE), and satisfaction in consultations with general practitioners (GPs), district nurses (DNs) and physiotherapists (PTs). Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire study of participants in planned consultations. Setting: Five primary health care centers and two rehabilitation centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects: Pairs of patients and GPs (n = 156), patients and DNs (n = 73), and patients and PTs (n = 69). Main outcome measures: Multiple-choice questions about patients' ICE and satisfaction. Results: Approximately 75% of patients and GPs reported that patients' thoughts and explanations about their symptoms emerged during the consultation. For patient-DN pairs, the figure was 60%, and for patient-PT pairs, 80%. A majority of patients reported not having concerns and anxiety about the investigation/treatment, whereas health care professionals thought patients were more concerned. One-third of patients consulting GPs and PTs expected to receive a reason/explanation for their symptoms. Figures were lower for the DNs. About 70% of patients were satisfied with the consultation. Conclusions: Most patients expressed their ideas, a minority had concerns, and a minority expected an explanation of their illness. Patients and health care professionals rated patient satisfaction high, but health care professionals tended to believe patients were less satisfied than patients reported they were.\", \"This article compares the organization of the Swedish health care system with that in three other countries, the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, focussing on three main areas: (1) the provision and financing (public or private) of health insurance, including the question of the quality of the insurance protection offered; (2) the organization of the production of health services, and the economic incentives on the system's decision-makers (doctors, hospital managers, politicians, etc.). Possible answers are suggested to the question why one country (the U.K.) is able to provide health care to its population at an average cost considerably below that of the others: Differences in the quality of the insurance protection and health services; in the incentives on the system managers to exercise cost control; and in the incentives on service providers such as physicians, to consider cost-effectiveness when making treatment decisions. An attempt is made to suggest lessons for health care reform in Sweden and elsewhere.\", 'Utilization-based approaches have predominated the measurement of socioeconomic-related inequity in health care. This approach, however, can be misleading when preferences over health and health care are correlated with socioeconomic status, especially when the underlying focus is on equity of access. We examine the potential usefulness of an alternative approach to assessing inequity of access using a direct measure of possible barriers to access-self-reported unmet need (SUN)-which is documented to vary with socioeconomic status and is commonly asked in health surveys. Specifically, as part of an assessment of its external validity, we use Canadian longitudinal health data to test whether self-reported unmet need in one period is associated with a subsequent deterioration in health status in a future period, and find that it is. This suggests that SUN does reflect in part reduced access to needed health care, and therefore may have a role in assessing health system equity as a complement to utilization-based approaches.', 'Population health care is health information and clinical services provided to individuals of a defined population. From a population health care perspective, quality of care involves the health status of the entire population, and thus issues of access, cost of care, and efficiency matter. In this paper, we describe the definitions of quality health care and the framework for measuring quality, with emphasis on the performance of organizations involved in the delivery and assurance of population health care. We describe quality measurement sets and systems, criteria for the choice of measures, data sources, and how quality measurements are used to improve health care and outcomes from a population health care perspective.', 'We show that when health care providers have market power and engage in Cournot competition, a competitive upstream health insurance market results in over-insurance and over-priced health care. Even though consumers and firms anticipate the price interactions between these two markets - the price set in one market affects the demand expressed in the other - Pareto improvements are possible. The results suggest a beneficial role for Government intervention, either in the insurance or the health care market. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit variation in treatment intensity from 2 sources: (1) local area prereform uninsured rates from 2013 and (2) state participation in the Medicaid expansion. Including the third postreform year leads to 2 important insights. First, gains in health insurance coverage and access to care from the policy continued to increase in the third year. Second, an improvement in the probability of reporting excellent health emerged in the third year, with the effect being largely driven by the non-Medicaid expansions components of the policy.', 'Objectives: Dental care for elderly nursing home residents is traditionally provided at fixed dental clinics, but domiciliary dental care is an emerging alternative. Longer life expectancy accompanied with increased morbidity, and hospitalisation or dependence on the care of others will contribute to a risk for rapid deterioration of oral health so alternative methods for delivering oral health care to vulnerable individuals for whom access to fixed dental clinics is an obstacle should be considered. The aim was to analyse health economic consequences of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents in Sweden, compared to dentistry at a fixed clinic. Methods: A review of relevant literature was undertaken complemented by interviews with nursing home staff, officials at county councils, and academic experts in geriatric dentistry. Domiciliary dental care and fixed clinic care were compared in cost analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. Results: The mean societal cost of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents was lower than dental care at a fixed clinic, and it was also considered cost-effective. Lower cost of dental care at a fixed dental clinic was only achieved in a scenario where dental care could not be completed in a domiciliary setting. Conclusions: Domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents has a lower societal cost and is cost-effective compared to dental care at fixed clinics. To meet current and predicted need for oral health care in the ageing population alternative methods to deliver dental care should be available.', 'Health disparities, also known as health inequities, are systematic and potentially remediable differences in one or more aspects of health across population groups defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically (88). This topic has been the subject of research stretching back at least decades. Reports and studies have delved into how inequities develop in different societies and, with particular regard to health services, in access to and financing of health systems. In this review, we consider empirical studies from the United States and elsewhere, and we focus on how one aspect of health systems, clinical care, contributes to maintaining systematic differences in health across population groups characterized by social disadvantage. We consider inequities in clinical care and the policies that influence them. We develop a framework for considering the structural and behavioral components of clinical care and review the existing literature for evidence that is likely to be generalizable across health systems over time. Starting with the assumption that health services, as one aspect of social services, ought to enhance equity in health care, we conclude with a discussion of threats to that role and what might be done about them.', 'Background:This paper provides statewide estimates on health care access and utilization patterns and physical and behavioral health by citizenship and documentation status among Latinos in California.Methods:This study used data from the 2011-2015 California Health Interview Survey to examine health care access and utilization and physical and behavioral health among a representative sample of all nonelderly Latino and US-born non-Latino white adults (N=51,386). Multivariable regressions estimated the associations between the dependent measures and citizenship/documentation status among Latinos (US-born, naturalized citizen, green card holder, and undocumented).Results:Adjusted results from multivariable analyses observed worse access and utilization patterns among immigrant Latinos compared with US-born Latinos, with undocumented immigrants using significantly less health care. Undocumented Latinos had lower odds of self-reporting excellent/very good health status compared with US-born Latinos, despite them having lower odds of having several physical and behavioral health outcomes (overweight/obesity, physician-diagnosed hypertension, asthma, self-reported psychological distress, and need for behavioral health services). Among those reporting a need for behavioral health services, access was also worse for undocumented Latinos when compared with US-born Latinos.Conclusions:Patterns of poor health care access and utilization and better physical and behavioral health are observed across the continuum of documentation status, with undocumented immigrants having the worst access and utilization patterns and less disease. Despite fewer reported diagnoses and better mental health, undocumented Latinos reported poorer health status than their US-born counterparts.', 'Objective To evaluate differences in access to behavioral health services for Medicaid enrollees covered by a Medicaid entity that integrated the financing of behavioral and physical health care (carve-in group) versus a Medicaid entity that separated this financing (carve-out group). Data Sources/Study Setting Medicaid claims data from two Medicaid entities in the Portland, Oregon tri-county area in 2016. Study Design In this cross-sectional study, we compared differences across enrollees in the carve-in versus carve-out group, using a machine learning approach to incorporate a large set of covariates and minimize potential selection bias. Our primary outcomes included behavioral health visits for a variety of different provider types. Secondary outcomes included inpatient, emergency department, and primary care visits. Data Collection We used Medicaid claims, including adults with at least 9 months of enrollment. Principal Findings The study population included 45,786 adults with mental health conditions. Relative to the carve-out group, individuals in the carve-in group were more likely to access outpatient behavioral health (2.39 percentage points, p < 0.0001, with a baseline rate of approximately 73%). The carve-in group was also more likely to access primary care physicians, psychologists, and social workers and less likely to access psychiatrists and behavioral health specialists. Access to outpatient behavioral health visits was more likely in the carve-in arrangement among individuals with mild or moderate mental health conditions (compared to individuals with severe mental illness) and among black enrollees (compared to white enrollees). Conclusions Financial integration of physical and behavioral health in Medicaid managed care was associated with greater access to behavioral health services, particularly for individuals with mild or moderate mental health conditions and for black enrollees. Recent changes to incentivize financial integration should be monitored to assess differential impacts by illness severity, race and ethnicity, provider types, and other factors.', \"This study concerns measuring the quality of health services in long-term residential mental health care. The issue of measuring the quality of health services has been limited to services at residential health care centers (ZOL). The aim of the study is to propose measures associated with the provision of services in long-term residential mental health care. Currently, there are no tools for measuring the psychiatric services provided. The consequence of that is that the monitoring-supervisory-control mechanism that should ensure the required level of quality of services provided in this area of psychiatric care is inefficient. The aim of the deliberations made in this study is presenting an appropriate set of measures to assess the performance of a residential health care provider, taking into account the specificity of long-term mental health care (ZOL). The application of the Team Patient Functioning Scale allows for the specification of the changes occurring in the patient's functioning and comparing them at time intervals, and indirectly causes the Team Patient Functioning Scale to be used to draw conclusions about the aggravation, stabilization, or regression of the illness, and to prove the effectiveness of the therapeutic team. The presented results of the application of the proposed measures may constitute a reference base - as a benchmark - for the improvement and development of the quality of health services for patients in residential health care centers in Poland.\", 'OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to compare the receipt of preventive health services for children with and without special health care needs and to identify predictors of these health services for children with special health care needs using nationally representative data. METHODS. Data from the 2002 and 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were analyzed. A total of 18 279 children aged 3 to 17 years were included in our study. The Child Preventive Health Supplement was used to identify caregiver recall of specific health screening measures and anticipatory guidance during the previous 12 months. Odds ratios were calculated for predictive factors of preventive services for children with special health care needs. RESULTS. The prevalence of special health care needs in children aged 3 to 17 years was 21.6%. Based on caregiver reports, 87.5% of children with special health care needs had >= 1 health screening measure checked in the past year compared with 73.1% of children without special health care needs. Receipt of >= 1 topic of anticipatory guidance was reported for 69.8% of children with special health care needs compared with 55.2% of children without special health care needs. Black and Hispanic caregivers of children with special health care needs were more likely than others to report receipt of all 6 categories of anticipatory guidance measured in this study. CONCLUSIONS. We found that caregivers of children with special health care needs were more likely to report receipt of anticipatory guidance and health screening than were caregivers of children without special health care needs. Although a majority of these caregivers reported receiving some health screening and anticipatory guidance on an annual basis, there are clear gaps in the delivery of preventive health services. This study identifies areas for improvement in the delivery of preventive health services for children with special health care needs and children in general.', \"The dental hygienist team member has an opportunity to coordinate care within an interprofessional practice as an oral health care manager. Background and purpose Although dental hygienists are currently practicing within interprofessional teams in settings such as pediatric offices, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and federally qualified health centers, they often still assume traditional responsibilities rather than practicing to the full extent of their training and licenses. This article explains the opportunity for the dental hygiene professional to embrace patient-centered care as an oral health care manager who can facilitate integration of oral and primary care in a variety of health care settings. Methods Based on an innovative model of collaboration between a college of dentistry and a college of nursing, an idea emerged among several faculty members for a new management method for realizing continuity and coordination of comprehensive patient care. Involved faculty members began working on the development of an approach to interprofessional practice with the dental hygienist serving as an oral health care manager who would address both oral health care and a patient's related primary care issues through appropriate referrals and follow-up. This approach is explained in this article, along with the results of several pilot studies that begin to evaluate the feasibility of a dental hygienist as an oral health care manager. Conclusion A health care provider with management skills and leadership qualities is required to coordinate the interprofessional provision of comprehensive health care. The dental hygienist has the opportunity to lead closer integration of oral and primary care as an oral health care manager, by coordinating the team of providers needed to implement comprehensive, patient-centered care.\", 'We investigate how utilization of primary care, specialist care, and emergency department (ED) care (and the mix across the three) changes in response to a change in health need. We determine whether any changes in utilization are impacted by socio-economic status. The use of a unique Australian data set that consists of a large survey linked to multiple years of detailed administrative records enables us to better control for individual heterogeneity and allows us to exploit changes in health that are related to the onset of two health shocks: a new diagnosis of diabetes and heart disease. We extend the analysis by also examining changes to patient out-of-pocket costs. We find significant differences in the mix between primary and specialist care use according to income and type of health shock but no evidence of using ED as a substitute for other care. Our results indicate that low- and high-income patients navigate very different pathways for their care following the onset of diabetes and to a lesser extent heart disease. These pathways appear to be chosen on the basis of ability to pay, rather than the most effective or efficient bundle of care delivered through a combination of GP and specialist care.', \"Background The recent Austrian Primary Care Act established new primary health care units (PHCUs) and obliged them to draw up a care strategy specifying their focal care tasks and objectives and emphasizing the health care needs of the population in their catchment area with its specific local health and epidemiological profile. The main purpose of these care strategies is thus to ensure that care-providers meet the local needs, but they also provide a rationale for evaluation and organizational development. To assist new PHCUs in establishing care strategies it was necessary to develop a method for automatically generating comprehensive local case studies for any freely definable location in Austria. Results We designed an interactive report generator capable of producing location-specific regional health care profiles for a PHCU located in any of Austria's 2122 municipalities and of calculating the radius of its catchment area (defined by different levels of maximum car-travelling times). The reports so generated, called regional health care profiles for primary health care (RHCPs/PHC), are in comprehensive PDF report format. The core of each report is a set of 35 indicators, classified under five health and health service domains. The reports include an introductory text, definitions, a map, a graphic and tabular presentation of all indicator values, including information on local, supra-regional and national value distribution, a ranking, and numbers of service providers (e.g. pharmacies, surgeries, nursing homes) located within the catchment area. Conclusions The RHCPs/PHC support primary health care planning, efforts to improve care-effectiveness, and strategic organizational development by providing comprehensive information on the health of the population, the utilization of health services and the health care structures within the catchment area. In addition to revealing the scope and nature of the health care needed, they also provide information on what public health approaches are necessary. RHCPs/PHC for different locations have already been distributed to numerous stakeholders and primary health care providers in Austria.\", 'Objective. To assess the role health insurance plays in influencing access to care and use of services by children with special health care needs. Methods. We analyzed data on 57 553 children younger than 18 years old included in the 1994-1995 National Health Interview Survey on Disability. The survey obtained information on special health care needs, insurance status, and access to and use of health services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of insurance with several measures of access and utilization, including usual source of care, site of usual care, missed or delayed care, and use of ambulatory physician services. Results. Using the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau definition of children with special health care needs, we estimate that 18% of US children under 18 years old had an existing special health care need in 1994-1995. An estimated 89% of these children had some form of health insurance coverage, most often private health insurance. Insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have a usual source of care (96.9% vs 79.2%). Among those with a usual source of care, insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have an identified regular clinician (87.6% vs 80.7%). Insured children were less likely to report unmet health needs, including medical care (2.2% vs 10.5%), dental care (6.1% vs 23.9%), prescriptions, and/or eyeglasses (3.1% vs 12.3%), and mental health care (.9% vs 3.4%). Insured children were also more likely to have a physician contact in the past year (89.3% vs 73.6%) and have more physician contacts on an annual basis (8.5 vs 4.1 contacts). Unexpectedly, no differences were found between insured and uninsured children in availability of after hours medical care (evenings and weekends) or satisfaction with care. We also found some modest differences in access between publicly and privately insured children. Privately insured children were more likely to have a usual source of care (97.6% vs 95.3%) and a regular clinician (91.0% vs 81.1%). Privately insured children were also less likely to report dissatisfaction with care at their usual site of care (14.9% vs 21.0%) and have access to care on evenings and weekends (6.8% vs 13.4%). No substantial differences were found between privately and publicly insured children in prevalence of unmet health needs or delays in obtaining care due to cost. Conclusions. This study illustrates the importance of health insurance for children with special health care needs. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that all children with special health care needs have insurance and that remaining access and utilization barriers for currently insured children with special health care needs are also addressed.', 'This article addresses the contribution that health care research can make to facilitating appropriate health care provision for older adults. First, the major risks in this age group are described. These include multiple illnesses, the increasing need for nursing care with age, but also the growing numbers of older adults with psychological disorders, primarily dementia. The second section of the article presents a critical assessment of the current health care situation in light of the risks identified. On this basis, the third section specifies the areas of health care research that can contribute to improving the quality of the health care provision for this population. The article is based on a presentation made by the author at the 2010 Berlin Talks on Social Medicine: The New Old - Health Care Research for a Changed Society.', \"INTRODUCTION A healthy workforce is vital for maintaining social and economic development on a global, national and local level. Around half of the world's people are economically active and spend at least one third of their time in their place of work while only 15% of workers have access to basic occupational health services. According to WHO report, since the early 1980s, health indicators in Iran have consistently improved, to the extent that it is comparable with those in developed countries. In this paper it was tried to briefly describe about Health care system and occupational Health Services as part of Primary Health care in Iran. METHODS To describe the health care system in the country and the status of occupational health services to the workers and employers, its integration into Primary Health Care (PHC) and outlining the challenges in provision of occupational health services to the all working population. FINDINGS Iran has fairly good health indicators. More than 85 percent of the population in rural and deprived regions, for instance, have access to primary healthcare services. The PHC centers provide essential healthcare and public-health services for the community. Providing, maintaining and improving of the workers' health are the main goals of occupational health services in Iran that are presented by different approaches and mostly through Workers' Houses in the PHC system. CONCLUSIONS Iran has developed an extensive network of PHC facilities with good coverage in most rural areas, but there are still few remote areas that might suffer from inadequate services. It seems that there is still no transparent policy to collaborate with the private sector, train managers or provide a sustainable mechanism for improving the quality of services. Finally, strengthening national policies for health at work, promotion of healthy work and work environment, sharing healthy work practices, developing updated training curricula to improve human resource knowledge including occupational health professionals are recommended.

However, less is known about whether postpartum health care receipt varies by the source of prenatal care.Materials and Methods: This study analyzed data from the 2011-2017 U.S. National Survey of Family Growth to examine associations between the source of prenatal care (private care facility, public/community health facility, other source, or no prenatal care) and nonreceipt of postpartum health care using weighted multivariable logistic regression models. This analysis did not require institutional review board approval.Results: Of the total estimation sample (N = 1,190), 10.8% of respondents reported not receiving postpartum health care. There were no statistically significant differences in nonreceipt of postpartum health care between women who received prenatal care from a public/community health facility or other source and those who attended a private facility. However, women who received no prenatal care had a higher likelihood of not receiving postpartum health care compared with those who attended a private facility (adjusted odds ratio 8.7, 95% confidence interval 4.3-17.5).Conclusions: Receiving prenatal care, regardless of the source, reduced the likelihood of a woman not receiving postpartum health care within a year after delivery. Interventions aimed at women who did not receive any prenatal care may be critical for improving postpartum health care use and subsequently preventing adverse maternal outcomes.', 'The care of pediatric patients with cancer and their families is complex and rapidly evolving. Despite significant advances in outcomes, symptoms of the disease and complications of therapy continue to cause suffering that may improve with the involvement of pediatric palliative care (PPC) services. This descriptive study responds to the observation of great variability in PPC utilization within pediatric oncology. Data collected from 156 health care professionals (nurses, advanced practice professionals, and physicians) from a statewide hematology alliance evaluates the knowledge, beliefs, and perceived barriers to PPC involvement. Data analysis reveals significant variability when comparing respondents from professional roles and practice environments. Despite progress in PPC availability, care delivery remains incongruent with current recommendations. Knowledge gained from this study emphasizes the important role for all health care providers in advocating for support of PPC programs, educating the public, and committing to intentional involvement of PPC services while caring for pediatric oncology patients.', \"BACKGROUND. Quantified measures of unmet health care needs can be used to evaluate health care interventions, assess the impact of managed care, monitor health status trends in populations, or assess equity of access to medical care across population subgroups. Such a measure needs to be simple, relatively easy to obtain, inexpensive, and appropriately targeted to the population of interest. OBJECTIVE. TO develop a measure of unmet health care needs that is specifically targeted to a pediatric population. SUBJECTS. Study participants consisted of children, aged 1 to 5 years (n = 1,031), and adolescent mothers, aged 13 to 19 years (n = 172), predominantly from poor, minority families in New York City. RESEARCH DESIGN. Based on a measure, the symptoms-response ratio, developed for all age groups, this study replicated Taylor's procedures specifically for children and adolescents. Respondents were asked if they had experienced a set of physical symptoms and if they saw a doctor in response. A panel of pediatricians rated the same symptoms as to whether health care should be sought. RESULTS. The measure achieved adequate inter-rater reliability and good construct validity. The children's overall use of health services did not differ from the pediatric panel's expectations, but with differing degrees of unmet needs by symptom. Adolescents sought care less often than the expert panel members believed they should. CONCLUSIONS. The symptoms-response ratio provides a good balance of a simple and inexpensive measure while yielding a fair estimate of unmet needs for primary care. This analysis created a pediatric measure targeted to the needs of young children and adolescent females.\", 'Background: Like other colonised populations, Indigenous Australians experience poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous Australians. Preventable chronic disease is the largest contributor to the health differential between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, but recommended best-practice preventive care is not consistently provided to Indigenous Australians. Significant improvement in health care delivery could be achieved through identifying and minimising evidence-practice gaps. Our objective was to use clinical audit data to create a framework of the priority evidence-practice gaps, strategies to address them, and drivers to support these strategies in the delivery of recommended preventive care. Methods: De-identified preventive health clinical audit data from 137 primary health care (PHC) centres in five jurisdictions were analysed (n = 17,108 audited records of well adults with no documented major chronic disease; 367 system assessments; 2005-2014), together with stakeholder survey data relating to interpretation of these data, using a mixed-methods approach (n = 152 responses collated in 2015-16). Stakeholders surveyed included clinicians, managers, policy officers, continuous quality improvement (CQI) facilitators and academics. Priority evidence-practice gaps and associated barriers, enablers and strategies to address the gaps were identified and reported back through two-stages of consultation. Further analysis and interpretation of these data were used to develop a framework of strategies and drivers for health service improvement. Results: Stakeholder identified priorities were: following-up abnormal test results; completing cardiovascular risk assessments; timely recording of results; recording enquiries about living conditions, family relationships and substance use; providing support for clients identified with emotional wellbeing risk; enhancing systems to enable team function and continuity of care. Drivers identified for improving care in these areas included: strong Indigenous participation in the PHC service; appropriate team structure and function to support preventive care; meaningful use of data to support quality of care and CQI; and corporate support functions and structures. Conclusion: The framework should be useful for guiding development and implementation of barrier-driven, tailored interventions for primary health care service delivery and policy contexts, and for guiding further research. While specific strategies to improve the quality of preventive care need to be tailored to local context, these findings reinforce the requirement for multi-level action across the system. The framework and findings may be useful for similar purposes in other parts of the world, with appropriate attention to context in different locations.', \"Background: Transgender people face a multitude of health care access barriers that create wide disparities in health. Transgender people have more untreated acute and chronic conditions than the cisgender population. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe positive and negative experiences of transgender people when accessing health care. Methodological orientation: Qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews and content analysis for identification of themes. Sample: Nine transgender people ranging in age from 20 to 35 years who currently reside in a metropolitan area of the Southwestern United States. Conclusions: The interviews contained candid stories about the participants' health care experiences and included perspectives about provider knowledge, provider communication, and provider office interactions. Findings identified health care disparities among transgender people related, in part, to negative experiences in the health care environment. Some of these negative experiences arose from the uncertainty of providers' transgender-specific health care knowledge and anxiety about dysphoria-triggering communication in the health care environment. Implications for practice: These findings enhance practice by offering insight into how health care providers and personnel interactions influence the experience of transgender patients and help health care providers and personnel understand situations that create anxiety and dysphoria in transgender patients.\", 'Background: Asian Americans have lower cancer screening rates than non-Latino Whites, suggesting inequities in cancer prevention among Asian Americans. Little is known about inequities in cancer treatment between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer. Methods: Using the 2002-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined inequities in access to care and health care spending between Whites and Asian Americans with and without cancer. Our outcomes included 3 measures of access to care and 3 measures of health care spending. We used multivariable regressions while adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need factors and estimated the mean adjusted values of the outcomes for each group. We then examined the differences in these adjusted mean outcomes among Asian Americans relative to Whites. Results: We observed evidence of inequities that Asian Americans without cancer experienced limited access to care due to a lack of a usual source of care. The likelihood of having a usual source of care was lower among Asian Americans without cancer than Whites without cancer. Inequities were not observed among Asian Americans with cancer. Compared with Whites with cancer, Asian Americans with cancer had similar or better levels of access to care. No or marginal differences in health care spending were detected between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer. These findings were consistent in both nonelderly and elderly groups. Conclusion: While Asian Americans without cancer have unmet medical needs due to limited access to care, access to care and spending are relatively equitable between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer.', 'Quality of care worries and rising costs have resulted in a widespread interest in enhancing the efficiency of health care delivery. One area of increasing interest is in promoting teamwork as a way of coordinating efforts to reduce costs and improve quality, and identifying the characteristics of the work environment that support teamwork. Relational climate is a measure of the work environment that captures shared employee perceptions of teamwork, conflict resolution, and diversity acceptance. Previous research has found a positive association between relational climate and quality of care, yet its relationship with costs remains unexplored. We examined the influence of primary care relational climate on health care costs incurred by diabetic patients at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs between 2008 and 2012. We found that better relational climate is significantly related to lower costs. Clinics with the strongest relational climate saved $334 in outpatient costs per patient compared with facilities with the weakest score in 2010. The total outpatient cost saving if all clinics achieved the top 5% relational climate score was $20 million. Relational climate may contribute to lower costs by enhancing diabetic treatment work processes, especially in outpatient settings.', \"OBJECTIVES. To determine the best predictors of the amount of children's health care use. RESEARCH DESIGN. Child health, psychosocial, and family status variables were collected. Families were then followed prospectively for 2 years to gather health care use data. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine factors related to volume of child health care use. SUBJECTS. 367 mothers and children ages 5 to 11 years continuously enrolled in a staff model HMO. MEASURES. Child health care visits obtained from a computerized database comprised the dependent variable. Independent variables were organized into a 5-component framework including: Demographic Characteristics; Family Characteristics; Child Health and Prior Health Care Use; Child Behavior and Mental Health; and Mothers' Mental Health and Health Care Use. RESULTS. The volume of a child's past health care use was the best predictor of future health care use, with the presence of past acute recurring illnesses, child pain and mother's retrospective health care use also serving as significant predictors in the model. Analysis of a second model was conducted omitting children's past use of health care. In this model the mother's worry about child health was the best predictor of use, with child health and child and maternal psychosocial variables significantly contributing to explained variance in the model. CONCLUSIONS. This study supports prior research indicating past use is the best predictor of future health care use. In addition, the study suggests that maternal perceptions of child health and maternal emotional functioning influence the decision-making process involved in seeking health care on behalf of children. Effective management of pediatric health care use needs to address broader needs of the child and family beyond solely the child's health, most notably maternal functioning.\", 'Background: Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent worldwide. Passive sensing technologies and applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods can provide an innovative means of supporting the management of mental health problems and enhancing the quality of care. However, the views of stakeholders are important in understanding the potential barriers to and facilitators of their implementation. Objective: This study aims to review, critically appraise, and synthesize qualitative findings relating to the views of mental health care professionals on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care. Methods: A systematic search of qualitative studies was performed using 4 databases. A meta-synthesis approach was used, whereby studies were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach within a critical realist epistemological framework. Results: Overall, 10 studies met the eligibility criteria. The 3 main themes were uses of passive sensing and AI in clinical practice, barriers to and facilitators of use in practice, and consequences for service users. A total of 5 subthemes were identified: barriers, facilitators, empowerment, risk to well-being, and data privacy and protection issues. Conclusions: Although clinicians are open-minded about the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, important factors to consider are service user well-being, clinician workloads, and therapeutic relationships. Service users and clinicians must be involved in the development of digital technologies and systems to ensure ease of use. The development of, and training in, clear policies and guidelines on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, including risk management and data security procedures, will also be key to facilitating clinician engagement. The means for clinicians and service users to provide feedback on how the use of passive sensing and AI in practice is being received should also be considered.

This inventory should be created and processed well in advance of the planned medical excursion. The key thing to remember in one's planning is to be a health care provider during one's global health care travel and not to become a patient oneself.

This survey was undertaken to identify these aspects of occupational health nurses and collect data on the topic in various countries. Methods A questionnaire was sent to prominent professionals in European countries and then to professionals in other countries. Results The study confirmed that very little is known about the number of occupational health nurses in this field. Training varies, but the more training they have, the more diversified their activities are. Conclusions This survey emphasizes the need to develop training and education for occupational health nurses so that they can efficiently help occupational health physicians and contribute towards assessing occupational risks among occupational health care workers, particularly in light of the lack of trained occupational health physicians.', 'Health care delivery in the United States has become complex and inefficient. With national health care gross domestic product and out-of-pocket expenses increasing, the nation has not yet improved the quality of health care compared with similar nations. As a result, the public asks for greater population health, improved patient experience, and reduced expenses. In this article, the author discuss how key stakeholders, including policy makers, health systems, patients, and employers, understand how these components of health care value are defined, interlink, and provide opportunities for improvement. The author also outlines concrete improvement opportunities from across the country.', 'Although a stated right for all Indians, equal access to health care in India is impeded by socioeconomic barriers. With its 3-tier system of public health care centers in villages, district hospitals, and tertiary care hospitals, government expenditure in India is inordinately low, with a disproportionate emphasis on private health spending. Accordingly, the poorest receive a minority of the available subsidies, whereas the richest obtain more than a third, fostering a divide in health care infrastructure across the rich and poor in urban and rural settings. This paradigm has implications for domestic Indian public health and global public health.', 'Aim: Our objective was to integrate lessons learned from perinatal collaborative care programs across the United States, recognizing the diversity of practice settings and patient populations, to provide guidance on successful implementation. Background: Collaborative care is a health services delivery system that integrates behavioral health care into primary care. While efficacious, effectiveness requires rigorous attention to implementation to ensure adherence to the core evidence base. Methods: Implementation strategies are divided into three pragmatic stages: preparation, program launch, and program growth and sustainment; however, these steps are non-linear and dynamic. Findings: The discussion that follows is not meant to be prescriptive; rather, all implementation tasks should be thoughtfully tailored to the unique needs and setting of the obstetric community and patient population. In particular, we are aware that implementation on the level described here assumes commitment of both effort and money on the part of clinicians, administrators, and the health system, and that such financial resources are not always available. We conclude with synthesis of a survey of existing collaborative care programs to identify implementation practices of existing programs.', \"Background. The ability to measure and improve the quality of children's health care is of national importance. Despite the existence of numerous health care quality measures, the collective ability of measures to assess children's health care quality is unclear. A review of existing health care quality measures for children is timely for both assessing the current state of quality measures for children and identifying areas requiring additional research and development. Objectives. To identify and collect current health care quality measures for child health and then to systematically categorize and classify measures and identify gaps in child health care quality measures requiring additional development. Design/Methods. We first identified child health care quality instruments with assistance from staff at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, experts in the field, the Computerized Needs-oriented Quality Measurement Evaluation System, the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, and a medical literature review. From these instruments, we then selected clinical performance measures applicable to children ( aged 0-18 years). We categorized the individual measures into the Institute of Medicine's framework for the National Health Care Quality Report. The framework includes health care quality domains ( patient safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, and timeliness) and patient-perspective domains ( staying healthy, getting better, living with illness, and end-of-life care). We then determined the balance of the measures ( how well they assess care for all children versus children with special health care needs) and their comprehensiveness ( how well the measures apply to the developmental range of children). Finally, we analyzed the ability of the measures to assess equity in care. Results. We identified 19 measure sets, and 396 individual measures were used to assess children's health care quality. The distribution of measures in the health care quality domains was: safety, 14.4%; effectiveness, 59.1%; patient-centeredness, 32.1%; and timeliness, 33.3%. The distribution of measures in the patient-perspective domains was: staying healthy, 24%; getting better, 40.2%; living with illness, 17.4%; end of life, 0%; and multidimensional, 23.5% ( measures were multidimensional if they applied to > 1 domain). Most of the measures were meant for use in the general pediatric population (81.1%), with a significant proportion designed for children with special health care needs (18.9%). The majority (greater than or equal to79%) of the measures could be applied to children across all age groups. However, there were relatively few measures designed specifically for each developmental stage. Regarding the use of measures to study equity in health care, 6 of the measure sets have been used in previous studies of equity. All the survey measure sets contain items that identify patients at risk for poor outcomes, and 4 are available in languages other than English. However, only 1 survey ( Consumer Assessment of Health Plans) has undergone studies of cross-cultural validation. Among the measure sets based on administrative data, 3 included infant mortality, a well-known measure of health disparity. Conclusions. There are several instruments designed to measure health care quality for children. Despite this, we found relatively few measures for assessing patient safety and living with illness and none for end-of-life care. Few measures are designed for specific age categories among children. Although equity is an overarching concern in health care quality, the application of current measures to assess disparities has been limited. These areas need additional research and development for a more complete assessment of health care quality for children.\", 'Patient care experience surveys evaluate the degree to which care is patient-centered. This article reviews the literature on the association between patient experiences and other measures of health care quality. Research indicates that better patient care experiences are associated with higher levels of adherence to recommended prevention and treatment processes, better clinical outcomes, better patient safety within hospitals, and less health care utilization. Patient experience measures that are collected using psychometrically sound instruments, employing recommended sample sizes and adjustment procedures, and implemented according to standard protocols are intrinsically meaningful and are appropriate complements for clinical process and outcome measures in public reporting and pay-for-performance programs.', 'Patients are not outpatients or inpatients, they are ill or healthy. Integrated Health Care provides a real chance to bring scientific innovations quickly from the laboratory to patients - and being payed for that. Although guidelines therefore are no compulsory exercise, they are tools to implement evidence-based use of innovative medical means. Health care providers should be reluctant to agree in guarantees for the success of medical therapies, since medical decisions may be influenced in different ways by that. Bureaucracy may hinder the spreading of Integrated Health Care; therefore simple regulations should be preferred. Reimbursement should not be designed according to conventional systems for outpatient or inpatient care, but as defined sums of money. That makes people sure to know what kind of contract they have agreed in.', \"Introduction: Children with special health care needs are an exponentially growing population needing integrated health care programmes that involve primary, community, hospital and tertiary care services. The aims of the study are (1) to develop and validate the Special Needs Kids Questionnaire (SpeNK-Q) designed to measure parents' perspective on continuity of care for children with special health care needs and (2) to evaluate the continuity of care based on parental experiences in this population. Methods: SpeNK-Q was derived from a previous qualitative study and was based on Haggerty's constructs of informational, management and relational continuity. Parents of preterm birth children completed the 20-item SpeNK-Q at the second or subsequent planned follow-up visit after the child's hospital discharge. Principal component analysis was used to examine the structure of the instrument. Results: Principal component analysis of 101 questionnaires administered allowed us to identify five factors explaining 60.2% of item variance: informational continuity; coordination of care; continuity of family-paediatrician relationship; family support; information on care plan. Conclusions and discussion: SpeNK-Q proved to be a psychometrically promising instrument. Its utilisation could improve the identification of areas for service development, the delivery of coordinated care and support policy makers in redesigning integrated services.\", \"China has recently emerged as an important global partner. However, like other developing nations, China has experienced dramatic demographic and epidemiologic changes in the past few decades. Population discontent with the health care system has led to major reforms. China's distinctive health care system, including its unique history, vast infrastructure, the speed of health reform, and economic capacity to make important advances in health care, nonetheless, has incomplete insurance coverage for urban and rural dwellers, uneven access, mixed quality of health care, increasing costs, and risk of catastrophic health expenditures.\", \"Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the evidence on how perceptions and/or experiences of weight bias in primary health care influence engagement with and utilization of health care services by individuals with obesity. Background: Prior studies have found discrepancies in the use of health care services by individuals living with obesity; a greater body mass index has been associated with decreased health care utilization, and weight bias has been identified as a major barrier to engagement with health services. Methods: PubMed was searched from January 2000 to July 2017. Four reviewers independently selected 21 studies examining perceptions of weight bias and its impact on engagement with primary health care services. Findings: A thematic analysis was conducted on the 21 studies that were included in this scoping review. The following 10 themes were identified: contemptuous, patronizing, and disrespectful treatment, lack of training, ambivalence, attribution of all health issues to excess weight, assumptions about weight gain, barriers to health care utilization, expectation of differential health care treatment, low trust and poor communication, avoidance or delay of health services, and 'doctor shopping'. Overall, our scoping review reveals how perceptions and/or experiences of weight bias from primary care health professionals negatively influence patient engagement with primary health care services.\", 'The purpose of this paper is to describe health profiles of adolescents in foster care. The Child Health and Illness Profile Adolescent Edition clustered adolescents in foster care into 13 mutually exclusive health profiles using dimensions of satisfaction with health, risks, resilience, and discomfort. Health profiles were further characterized into four health status rankings from best to worst health status. Many reported best health status (39%); nearly equal numbers (30.6%) had profiles indicating poor or worst health status, particularly girls and those with high risk behaviors, aggression, sexual abuse, or suicidality. It is valuable to identify health characteristics of the most vulnerable subgroups of foster youth to tailor specific interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This present study extends prior research by examining the contribution of NHSC and non-NHSC clinicians to medical and behavioral health costs per visit. Methods: Using 2013-2017 data from 1022 federally qualified health centers merged with the NHSC participant data, we constructed multivariate linear regression models with health center and year fixed effects to examine the marginal effect of each additional NHSC and non-NHSC staff full-time equivalent (FTE) on medical and behavioral health care costs per visit in CHCs. Results: On average, each additional NHSC behavioral health staff FTE was associated with a significant reduction of 3.55 dollars of behavioral health care costs per visit in CHCs and was associated with a larger reduction of 7.95 dollars in rural CHCs specifically. In contrast, each additional non-NHSC behavioral health staff FTE did not significantly affect changes in behavioral health care costs per visit. Each additional NHSC primary care staff FTE was not significantly associated with higher medical care costs per visit, while each additional non-NHSC clinician contributed to a slight increase of $0.66 in medical care costs per visit. Conclusions: Combined with previous findings on productivity, the present findings suggest that the use of NHSC clinicians is an effective approach to improving the capacity of CHCs by increasing medical and behavioral health care visits without increasing costs of services in CHCs, including rural health centers.', \"People with serious mental illness have increased rates of physical ill-health and reduced contact with primary care services. In Australia, the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program (MHNIP) was developed to facilitate access to mental health services. However, as a primary care service, the contribution to physical health care is worthy of consideration. Thirty-eight nurses who were part of the MHNIP participated in a national survey of nurses working in mental health about physical health care. The survey invited nurses to report their views on the physical health of consumers and the regularity of physical health care they provide. Physical health-care provision in collaboration with general practitioners (GPs) and other health-care professionals was reported as common. The findings suggest that the MHNIP provides integrated care, where nurses and GPs work in collaboration, allowing enough time to discuss physical health or share physical health activities. Consumers of this service appeared to have good access to physical and mental health services, and nurses had access to primary care professionals to discuss consumers' physical health and develop their clinical skills in the physical domain. The MHNIP has an important role in addressing physical health concerns, in addition to the mental health issues of people accessing this service.\", 'The primary goal of this paper is to present an analytical framework for estimating the costs of methods designed to bridge language barriers in health care. The material presented here is written for health care administrators and public health officials who are evaluating, or who expect to evaluate, the results of analyses and published studies on the economic consequences of language programs in health cave. This paper also may be seen as providing guidelines for researchers and students interested in designing and conducting economic studies of such language programs. A taxonomy of methods that have been developed to bridge language barriers in health care is discussed. Economic principles for assessing costs of these methods then are described, as well as their potential applications by health care institutions. Last, these principles are illustrated by comparing the implementation costs of two interpretive services.', \"BackgroundIntegrated people-centred health services (IPCHS) are vital for ensuring comprehensive care towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The World Health Organisation (WHO) envisions IPCHS in delivery and access to health services. This scoping review aimed to synthesize available evidence on people-centred primary health care (PHC) and primary care.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of published literature on people-centred PHC. We searched eight databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) using search terms related to people-centred and integrated PHC/primary care services. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist to select studies. We analyzed data and generated themes using Gale's framework thematic analysis method. Themes were explained under five components of the WHO IPCHS framework.ResultsA total of fifty-two studies were included in the review; most were from high-income countries (HICs), primarily focusing on patient-centred primary care. Themes under each component of the framework included: engaging and empowering people and communities (engagement of community, empowerment and empathy); strengthening governance and accountability (organizational leadership, and mutual accountability); reorienting the model of care (residential care, care for multimorbidity, participatory care); coordinating services within and across sectors (partnership with stakeholders and sectors, and coordination of care); creating an enabling environment and funding support (flexible management for change; and enabling environment).ConclusionsSeveral people-centred PHC and primary care approaches are implemented in HICs but have little priority in low-income countries. Potential strategies for people-centred PHC could be engaging end users in delivering integrated care, ensuring accountability, and implementing a residential model of care in coordination with communities. Flexible management options could create an enabling environment for strengthening health systems to deliver people-centred PHC services.\", 'This paper focuses on the improvement of the health characteristics in European countries including the life expectancy of their inhabitants. The primary objective is to describe, compare and analyze the status and development in the Czech Republic and other countries of the European Union in terms of the key health care indicators and population health status in relation to the economy related indicators the authors have chosen. The secondary objective is to verify the hypothesis which states that the health status of the population represented by the indicator of life expectancy is closely related to the economic level of individual countries as well as to the amount of total expenditure on health care. Based on the results of the analysis we can conclude that the Czech Republic balances on the border of the group of countries with average values of indicators and the group with poorer values. The results also suggest relatively strong ties between the economic level and health status of the population represented by life expectancy.', 'IntroductionThe promotion of health literacy of the population in a situation of migration, in the community, is a fundamental field of intervention in health promotion, for the reduction of inequalities in access to health care services. It is increasingly necessary to make health care services more equitable for migrant populations. The aim of the study was to characterize the level of health literacy of the population in a migrant situation, attending a primary health care unit in the Lisbon region, to identify priority areas for community intervention that will become the focus of intervention and contribute to the increase in the health literacy levels in this population. MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out by applying the Health Literacy Survey (ILS-PT) to a sample of the population in a situation of migration, found by 27 participants. ResultsThe general health literacy index of the sample is inadequate (21.23 points). An analysis of the sub-indexes revealed that 75% of the participants had difficulties related to information about health care and 80% had difficulties in the field of health promotion. ConclusionsProblematic and inadequate levels of health literacy was significantly frequent among migrant population. So that enhancing health literacy among migrant is essential to reduce health inequalities to achieve better health outcomes and contribute to defense of human rights of this vulnerable population.', 'Objective. To assess the contents of antenatal care and to relate the findings to the adequacy of maternal health care Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Public secondary health-care facilities. Participants. Pregnant women. Interventions. Three hundred and ninety consecutive pregnant women attending 12 selected secondary health facilities were recruited proportionate to the client load recorded for each facility during the year preceding the study. Interviews were conducted using the antenatal care exit interview form of the Safe Motherhood Needs Assessment package. Main Outcome Measures. Antenatal care services provided to pregnant women in current pregnancy Results. Blood pressure measurement, abdominal palpation and detection of foetal heart rate were provided to all participants. Three hundred and eighty-six (99%) were reached with at least one educational message. One hundred and sixty-seven (42.8%) had haemoglobin or packed cell volume estimated, whereas 168 (43.1%) had urine checked for protein, at least once during antenatal visits. Routine iron and folate supplements, and malaria prophylaxis were, respectively, given to 142 (36.4%) and 25 (6.4%). Conclusions. The antenatal care service as provided had reasonable capacity for intervention against pre-eclampsia and some foetal problems, and could contribute to delivery in a health facility and by a health worker. Capacity to address the possible effects of severe anaemia and malaria in pregnancy was lacking. Equipping health-care facilities with capacity to detect anaemia and proteinuria as well as ensuring that iron and folate supplements, and malaria prophylaxis are given to all pregnant women would help to meet national guidelines and improve quality of service.', \"Breast cancer diagnosis was used as a frame for identification of the complex health care requirements. Modem health care trends in patients with breast carcinoma as well as a constant search for improvements have the implementation of health care principles for every individual patient as their goal. Breast carcinoma is not a single trauma, but a long-term and multiple trauma with stressor varying in its intensity and nature. It requests a continual medical treatment, controls, and health care in all the stages of the disease and all the therapy modalities. The opinion that the patients should actively participate in planning and realization of the activities contributes to the fact that they take over a part of responsibility during surgical, chemo and radiotherapeutic treatment, as well as during the rehabilitation process. The quality of life includes the concepts of physical health, psychological and spiritual interest, family relations, social and economic status, health care principles in patients with breast carcinoma improve the quality of life of such patients with good cooperation, connectivity and communication of the patient, members of the medical team and the members of the patient's family.\", \"Objectives: To examine utilisation of primary health care services (subsidised by the Australian Government, Medicare Benefits Schedule, MBS) before and after entry into long-term care (LTC) in Australia.Methods: A retrospective cohort study of older people (aged >= 65 years) who entered LTC in Australia between 2012 and 2016 using the Historical Cohort of the Registry of Senior Australians. MBS-subsidised general attendances (general practitioner (GP), medical and nurse practitioners), health assessment and management plans, allied health, mental health services and selected specialist attendances accessed in 91-day periods 12 months before and after LTC entry were examined. Adjusted relative changes in utilisation 0-3 months before and after LTC entry were estimated using risk ratios (RR) calculated using Generalised Estimating Equation Poisson models.Results: 235,217 residents were included in the study with a median age of 84 years (interquartile range 79-89) and 61.1% female. In the first 3 months following LTC entry, GP / medical practitioner attendances increased from 86.6% to 95.6% (aRR 1.10 95%CI 1.10-1.11), GP / medical practitioner urgent after hours (from 12.3% to 21.1%; aRR 1.72, 95%CI 1.70-1.74) and after-hours attendances (from 18.5% to 33.8%; aRR 1.83, 95%CI 1.81-1.84) increased almost two-fold. Pain, palliative and geriatric specialist medicine attendances were low in the 3 months prior (<3%) and decreased further following LTC admission.Conclusion: There is an opportunity to improve the utilisation of primary health care services following LTC entry to ensure that residents' increasingly complex care needs are adequately met.\", 'ObjectiveTo evaluate the impacts of a transition to an integrated managed care model, wherein Medicaid managed care organizations moved from a carve-out model to a carve-in model integrating the financing of behavioral and physical health care. Data Sources/Study SettingMedicaid claims data from Washington State, 2014-2019, supplemented with structured interviews with key stakeholders. Study DesignThis mixed-methods study used difference-in-differences models to compare changes in two counties that transitioned to financial integration in 2016 to 10 comparison counties maintaining carve-out models, combined with qualitative analyses of 15 key informant interviews. Quantitative outcomes included binary measures of access to outpatient mental health care, primary care, the emergency department (ED), and inpatient care for mental health conditions. Data CollectionMedicaid claims were collected administratively, and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Principal FindingsThe transition to financially integrated care was initially disruptive for behavioral health providers and was associated with a temporary decline in access to outpatient mental health services among enrollees with serious mental illness (SMI), but there were no statistically significant or sustained differences after the first year. Enrollees with SMI also experienced a slight increase in access to primary care (1.8%, 95% CI 1.0%-2.6%), but no sustained statistically significant changes in the use of ED or inpatient services for mental health care. The transition to financially integrated care had relatively little impact on primary care providers, with few changes for enrollees with mild, moderate, or no mental illness. ConclusionsFinancial integration of behavioral and physical health in Medicaid managed care did not appear to drive clinical transformation and was disruptive to behavioral health providers. States moving towards carve-in models may need to incorporate support for practice transformation or financial incentives to achieve the benefits of coordinated mental and physical health care.', 'Background The role of socioeconomic factors as determinants of oncology consultations for advanced cancers in public payer health care systems is unknown. This study examined the association between material deprivation and receipt of cancer care among patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Methods This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of noncuratively treated patients with GI cancer diagnosed from 2007 to 2017. Material deprivation, representing income, quality of housing, education, and family structure, was defined as quintiles on the basis of 2016 census data. The first consultation with a radiation oncologist or medical oncologist and the receipt of 1 or more instances of radiation and/or chemotherapy were measured in the year after diagnosis. Adjusted, cause-specific Cox proportional hazards competing risk analyses were used (competing event = death). Results This study included 34,022 noncuratively treated patients with GI cancer. Consultation rates ranged from 67.8% for those in the most materially deprived communities to 73.5% for those in the least materially deprived communities. Among those with a consult, rates of cancer-directed therapy ranged from 58.5% for patients in the most materially deprived communities to 62.3% for patients in the least materially deprived communities. Patients living in the most materially deprived communities were significantly less likely to see a radiation and/or medical oncologist after a diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.92) and significantly less likely to receive radiation and/or chemotherapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76-0.85) than those living in the least materially deprived communities. Conclusions This study identified socioeconomic disparities in accessing cancer care. Continued efforts at examining and developing evidence-based policies for interventions that begin before or at the time of oncologist consultation are required to address root causes of inequities.', 'Aim: This study aimed to identify and reach consensus among primary health care participants [registered nurses (RNs) who receive clients, directors of nursing, senior physicians, health promotion officers, and local councillors] on the types of service provider that RNs who receive clients represent in the implementation of health promotion practices in primary health care in Eastern Finland. Background: There is an increasing focus on public health thinking in many countries as the population ages. To meet the growing needs of the health promotion practices of populations, advance practice has been recognized as effective in the primary health care setting. The advance practice nurses share many common features, such as being RNs with additional education, possessing competencies to work independently, treating clients in both acute and primary care settings, and applying a variety of health promotion practices into nursing. Methods: The two-stage modified Delphi method was applied. In round one, semi-structured interviews were conducted among primary health care participants (n = 42) in 11 health centres in Eastern Finland. In round two, a questionnaire survey was conducted in the same health centres. The questionnaire was answered by 64% of those surveyed (n = 56). For data analysis, content analysis and descriptive statistics were used. Findings: This study resulted in four types of service provider that RNs who receive clients represented in the implementation of health promotion practices in the primary health care setting in Eastern Finland. First, the client-oriented health promoter demonstrated four dimensions, which reached consensus levels ranging between 82.1 and 89.3%. Second, the developer of health promotion practices comprised four dimensions, which reached consensus levels between 71.4 and 85.7%. Third, the member of multi-professional teams of health promotion practices representing three dimensions, with consensus levels between 69.6 and 82.1%. Fourth, the type who showed interest towards health policy reached a consensus level of 55.4% in this study.', 'Background: Health system weaknesses in Africa are broadly well known, constraining progress on reducing the burden of both communicable and non-communicable disease (Afr Health Monitor, Special issue, 2011, 14-24), and the key challenges in leadership, governance, health workforce, medical products, vaccines and technologies, information, finance and service delivery have been well described (Int Arch Med, 2008, 1: 27). This paper uses focus group methodology to explore health worker perspectives on the challenges posed to integration of mental health into primary care by generic health system weakness. Methods: Two ninety minute focus groups were conducted in Nyanza province, a poor agricultural region of Kenya, with 20 health workers drawn from a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a mental health training programme for primary care, 10 from the intervention group clinics where staff had received the training programme, and 10 health workers from the control group where staff had not received the training). Results: These focus group discussions suggested that there are a number of generic health system weaknesses in Kenya which impact on the ability of health workers to care for clients with mental health problems and to implement new skills acquired during a mental health continuing professional development training programmes. These weaknesses include the medicine supply, health management information system, district level supervision to primary care clinics, the lack of attention to mental health in the national health sector targets, and especially its absence in district level targets, which results in the exclusion of mental health from such district level supervision as exists, and the lack of awareness in the district management team about mental health. The lack of mental health coverage included in HIV training courses experienced by the health workers was also striking, as was the intensive focus during district supervision on HIV to the detriment of other health issues. Conclusion: Generic health system weaknesses in Kenya impact on efforts for horizontal integration of mental health into routine primary care practice, and greatly frustrate health worker efforts. Improvement of medicine supplies, information systems, explicit inclusion of mental health in district level targets, management and supervision to primary care are likely to greatly improve primary care health worker effectiveness, and enable training programmes to be followed by better use in the field of newly acquired skills. A major lever for horizontal integration of mental health into the health system would be the inclusion of mental health in the national health sector reform strategy at community, primary care and district levels rather than just at the higher provincial and national levels, so that supportive supervision from the district level to primary care would become routine practice rather than very scarce activity.', \"Background: Health financing and delivery reforms designed to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) need to be informed by an understanding of factors that both promote access to health care and undermine it. This study examines the level of health care utilisation in Timor-Leste and the factors that drive it. Methods: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of health care utilisation in 1712 households were used to develop multilevel models exploring how need and predisposing and enabling factors explain health care utilisation at both primary and secondary care facilities. Results: Need was found to be the key driver in seeking both primary care and hospital services. Rural households were less likely to go to hospital (odds ratio 0.7) than urban households. The poorest quintile was also less likely to use more expensive hospital services than other socio-economic groups. Conclusions: Understanding the determinants of seeking health care in Timor-Leste is of considerable policy significance, because health care is free at the point of use. Our findings indicate that the public resources for health care are subsidising the rich more than the poor. Health care reforms in Timor-Leste need to reduce the 'other' costs of health care, such as distance barriers, to address these inequities.\", 'To determine if prior use of health services predicts subsequent risk of unemployment and to describe the acute effects of exposure to unemployment on the use of health care services.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause and cause-specific rates of hospital admission and ambulatory physician contacts over the period 1983-89 were compared between unemployed and employed individuals across four consecutive time periods related to the onset of unemployment. RESULTS: Adjusted rates of hospitalisation admission and physician contacts were higher among the unemployed across all four periods. When persons with a history of mental health treatment were excluded, health care use in the period prior to the onset of unemployment was equivalent among the employed and unemployed. Controlling for mental health treatment history, all-cause and cause-specific health care use was elevated among the unemployed during the unemployment spell. CONCLUSIONS: Unemployed individuals had increased hospitalisation rates before their current spell of unemployment. Much of this difference is due to the subgroup with prior mental health treatment. For individuals without prior mental health care, hospitalisation increased following a period of unemployment.', 'ObjectiveTo assess the impact of the Health Care Homes (HCH) primary health care initiative on quality of care and patient outcomes.Design, settingQuasi-experimental, matched cohort study; analysis of general practice data extracts and linked administrative data from ten Australian primary health networks, 1 October 2017 - 30 June 2021.ParticipantsPeople with chronic health conditions (practice data extracts: 9811; linked administrative data: 10 682) enrolled in the HCH 1 October 2017 - 30 June 2019; comparison groups of patients receiving usual care (1:1 propensity score-matched).InterventionParticipants were involved in shared care planning, provided enhanced access to team care, and encouraged to seek chronic condition care at the HCH practice where they were enrolled. Participating practices received bundled payments based on clinical risk tier.Main outcome measuresAccess to care, processes of care, diabetes-related outcomes, hospital service use, risk of death.ResultsDuring the first twelve months after enrolment, the mean numbers of general practitioner encounters (rate ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.17) and Medicare Benefits Schedule claims for allied health services (rate ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33) were higher for the HCH than the usual care group. Annual influenza vaccinations (relative risk, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.22) and measurements of blood pressure (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11), blood lipids (relative risk, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.21), glycated haemoglobin (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08), and kidney function (relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11-1.15) were more likely in the HCH than the usual care group during the twelve months after enrolment. Similar rate ratios and relative risks applied in the second year. The numbers of emergency department presentations (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18) and emergency admissions (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22) were higher for the HCH group during the first year; other differences in hospital use were not statistically significant. Differences in glycaemic and blood pressure control in people with diabetes in the second year were not statistically significant. By 30 June 2021, 689 people in the HCH group (6.5%) and 646 in the usual care group (6.1%) had died (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96-1.20).ConclusionsThe HCH program was associated with greater access to care and improved processes of care for people with chronic diseases, but not changes in diabetes-related outcomes, most measures of hospital use, or risk of death.', 'Aim. To describe health care reforms and analyze the transition of the health care system in Romania in the 1989-2001 period. Method. We analyzed policy documents, political intentions and objectives of health care reform, described new legislation, and presented changes in financial resources of the health care system. Results. The reforms of the health care system in Romania have been realized in a rather difficult context of scarcity of financial and human resources. The Gross Domestic Product spent on health care in 2000 was 4% and the number of physicians in 1999 was 42,975. The main changes due to the legislative reforms have been the introduction of a new social health insurance and strengthening of the position of family physicians. Negative effects of the reforms have been the decrease in health care accessibility and growing inequity in utilization of health care services. Health care users still pay physicians under-the-table, and have more out-of-pocket health care expenses. Conclusion. Future reforms in Romania should encourage the positive effects of current reforms: free choice of physician, autonomy of the primary health care system, and increasing financial resources for the health care system.', \"Being a family member of a patient who is being treated in an acute care setting for cancer often involves a number of challenges. Our study describes Norwegian cancer care health professionals' perceptions of family members who served as family caregivers (FCs) and their need for support during the in-hospital cancer treatment of their ill family member. Focus group discussions were conducted with a multidisciplinary team of 24 experienced social workers, physicians, and nurses who were closely involved in the patients' in-hospital cancer treatment and care. Drawing on qualitative hermeneutic analysis, four main themes describe health professionals' perceptions of FCs during the patient's in-hospital cancer care: an asset and additional burden, infinitely strong and struggling with helplessness, being an outsider in the center of care, and being in different temporalities. We conclude that it is a challenge for health care professionals to support the family and create room for FC's needs in acute cancer care. System changes are needed in health care, so that the patient/FC dyad is viewed as a unit of care in a dual process of caregiving, which would enable FCs to be given space and inclusion in care, with their own needs simultaneously considered alongside those of the patient.\", 'In Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa, health care financing is progressive overall. However, out-of-pocket payments and health insurance for the informal sector are regressive. The distribution of health care benefits is generally pro-rich. This paper explores the factors influencing these distributions in the three countries. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with insurance scheme members, the uninsured, health care providers and managers. Household surveys were also conducted in all countries. Flat-rate contributions contributed to the regressivity of informal sector voluntary schemes, either by design (in Tanzania) or due to difficulties in identifying household income levels (in Ghana). In all three countries, the regressivity of out-of-pocket payments is due to the incomplete enforcement of exemption and waiver policies, partial or no insurance cover among poorer segments of the population and limited understanding of entitlements among these groups. Generally, the pro-rich distribution of benefits is due to limited access to higher level facilities among poor and rural populations, who rely on public primary care facilities and private pharmacies. Barriers to accessing health care include medical and transport costs, exacerbated by the lack of comprehensive insurance coverage among poorer groups. Service availability problems, including frequent drug stock-outs, limited or no diagnostic equipment, unpredictable opening hours and insufficient skilled staff also limit service access. Poor staff attitudes and lack of confidence in the skills of health workers were found to be important barriers to access. Financing reforms should therefore not only consider how to generate funds for health care, but also explicitly address the full range of affordability, availability and acceptability barriers to access in order to achieve equitable financing and benefit incidence patterns.', \"Background According to the World Health Organization, palliative care is one of the main components of healthcare. As the incidence of cancer is increasing in the world, home-based palliative care can be beneficial for many patients. This study was designed to explore health care providers' perceptions about home-based palliative care in terminally ill cancer patients. Methods This qualitative study was carried out using the conventional content analysis from October 2016 to September 2018 in Iran. Participants were home care providers who were selected using purposive sampling. The data were collected through 18 individual interviews, and a focus group meeting. Data were analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results from the data analysis, 511 initial codes were extracted, which were categorized into the two main categories of challenges and opportunities for home-based palliative care and 10 subcategories. The subcategories of challenges included deficiencies in inter-sectoral and inter-professional cooperation, lack of infrastructures for end-of-life care, challenges related to the management of death, challenges of transferring patients to home, providing non-academic palliative care, lack of political commitment of the government and Spiritual vacuum. The category of opportunities included subcategories of cost-effectiveness, moving towards socializing health, and structure of the health system. Conclusions Home-based palliative care requires government and health system support. Structural and process modification in the healthcare can provide conditions in which terminally ill cancer patients receive appropriate care in home and experience death with dignity through support of family, friends and healthcare.\", 'This paper describes models and strategies currently used in various health care settings around the country to improve health cave access for limited English-proficient (LEP) individuals and examines a spectrum of strategies that overcome barriers to care, including the use of bilingual providers, bilingual/bicultural community health workers, professional and nonprofessional interpreters, the role of written translations, and new approaches to interpretation that use technological advances. The paper also considers how these strategies are applied in a variety of health care organizations, such as community health centers, public health departments, hospitals, and managed care organizations. Specific examples of model programs and strategies in each of these health care settings are described. Finally, recommendations ave reviewed that may assist institutions in improving the provision of health care for LEP populations.', 'The aim of this study was to assess: (1) the proportion of youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) with adequate transition preparation, (2) whether transition preparation differs by individual, condition-related and health care system-related factors, and (3) whether specific components of the medical home are associated with adequate transition preparation. The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 17,114 parents of YSHCN ages 12 to 18 years. Adequate transition preparation was based on positive responses to questions about transition to an adult provider, changing health care needs, maintaining insurance coverage, and if providers encouraged YSHCN to take responsibility for health care needs. Weighted descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between patient and health care system factors and adequate transition preparation. Overall, 32.1% of YSHCN had adequate transition preparation. Older age, female sex, income <= 400% of the poverty level, lack of medical complexity, and having shared decision making, family-centered care, and effective care coordination were associated with increased odds of transition preparation. The majority of YSHCN do not receive adequate transition preparation and younger, male adolescents with medical complexity were less likely to receive transition preparation. Different patterns of disparities were identified for each subcomponent measure of transition preparation, which may help target at-risk populations for specific services. Efforts to improve transition preparation should leverage specific components of the medical home including care coordination, shared decision making, and family-centered care.', 'ObjectiveThis study aimed to look at the practices and perspectives of residential aged care facility (RACF) care staff regarding the provision of oral health care in RACFs. BackgroundEmphasis has been placed on the provision of adequate oral health care in RACFs through the Better Oral Health in Residential Aged Care programme. Endorsed by the Australian government, this programme provided oral health education and training for aged care staff. However, recent evidence suggests that nearly five years after the implementation of this programme, the provision of oral care in RACFs in NSW remains inadequate. Materials and MethodsThis project utilised an exploratory qualitative design which involved a focus group with 12 RACF care staff. Participants were asked to discuss the current oral health practices in their facility, and their perceived barriers to providing oral health care. ResultsThe key findings demonstrated current oral health practices and challenges among care staff. Most care staff had received oral health training and demonstrated positive attitudes towards providing dental care. However, some participants identified that ongoing and regular training was necessary to inform practice and raise awareness among residents. Organisational constraints and access to dental services also limited provision of dental care while a lack of standardised guidelines created confusion in defining their role as oral healthcare providers in the RACF. ConclusionThis study highlighted the need for research and strategies that focus on capacity building care staff in oral health care and improving access of aged care residents to dental services.', 'Skyrocketing health care costs are burdening our people and our economy, yet health care indicators show how little we are achieving with the money we spend. Federal and state governments, along with public-health experts and policymakers, are proposing a host of new initiatives to find solutions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is designed to address both the quality and accessibility of health care, while reducing its cost. This article provides an overview of models supported by the Affordable Care Act that address one or more goals of the Triple Aim: better health care for individuals, better health outcomes in the community, and lower health care costs. The models described below rely on the core principles of primary care: comprehensive, coordinated and continuous primary care; preventive care; and the sophisticated implementation of health information technology designed to promote communication between health care providers, enhance coordination of care, minimize duplication of services, and permit reporting on quality. These models will support better health care and reduced costs for people who access health care services but will not address health outcomes in the community at large. Health care professionals, working in concert with community-based organizations and advocates, must also address conditions that influence health in the broadest sense to truly improve the health of our communities and reduce health care costs. Mt Sinai J Med 79:527534, 2012. (c) 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine', 'Background: Almost all studies of post-acute care (PAC) focus on older persons, frequently those suffering from chronic health problems. Some research is available on PAC for the pediatric population in general. However, very few studies focus on PAC services for children with special health care needs (SHCN). Objective: To investigate factors affecting the provision of PAC to children with SHCN. Methods: Pooled cross-sectional data from Texas Department of State Health Services hospital discharge database from 2011-2014 were analyzed. Publicly available algorithms identified chronic conditions, complex chronic conditions, and the principal problem leading to hospitalization. Analysis involved estimating two logistic regressions, with clustered robust standard errors, concerning the likelihood of receiving PAC and where that PAC was delivered. Models included patient characteristics and conditions, as well as hospital characteristics and location. Results: Only 5.8 percent of discharges for children with SHCN resulted in the provision of PAC. Two-thirds of PAC was provided in a health care facility (HCF). Severity of illness and the number of complex chronic conditions, though not the number of chronic problems, made PAC more likely. Patient demographics had no effect on PAC decisions. Hospital type and location also affected PAC decision-making. Conclusions: PAC was provided to relatively few children with SHCN, which raises questions concerning the potential underutilization of PAC for children with SHCN. Also, the provision of most PAC in a HCF (66%) seems at odds with professional judgment and family preferences indicating that health care for children with SHCN is best provided in the home. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.', 'Integrated care is expected to improve patient experience, patient outcomes and assist with the increasing demand on health services from those with long term conditions including mental disorder. Few studies have evaluated health care utilization as a consequence of increased integration of mental health care. This study considers the factors known to influence secondary health service utilization and investigated the impact of a locality based mental health integrated model of care (ILoC) providing specialist consultation and liaison advice to primary care, to support early diagnosis and treatment. Using existing hospital databases, the study-cohort was identified (service users supported by ILoC, and then referred within 6 months to specialist mental health services (MHS) care between 2017- 2018) and compared on health services utilization with a matched-cohort (without ILoC support before referral to specialist services). The length-of-care in the non-acute MHS was 71% shorter for the ILoC study-cohort, and differences increased in the subgroup taking antidepressants. The ILoC study-cohort was less likely to be admitted to acute MHS on first referral post ILoC intervention and had a 25% lower relative risk of acute MHS admissions at any time in follow-up. There was no difference in the average MHS inpatient length-of-stay. The risk of general hospital acute inpatient admission was marginally higher in the ILoC study-cohort. Conclusions: ILoC appears to shorten non-acute length-of-specialist-care and reduce acute mental health admission. The study provides a first step in understanding the clinical characteristics and specialist services health-care utilization of patients supported by an integrated mental care approach.', \"BackgroundChildren in the UK care system often face multiple disadvantages in terms of health, education and future employment. This is especially true of mental health where they present with greater mental health needs than other children. Although transition from care - the process of leaving the local authority as a child-in-care to independence - is a key juncture for young people, it is often experienced negatively with inconsistency in care and exacerbation of existing mental illness. Those receiving support from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), often experience an additional, concurrent transfer to adult services (AMHS), which are guided by different service models which can create a care gap between services. MethodThis qualitative study explored care-leavers' experiences of mental illness, and transition in social care and mental health services. Twelve care-leavers with mental health needs were interviewed and data analysed using framework analysis. ResultsSixteen individual themes were grouped into four superordinate themes: overarching attitudes towards the care journey, experience of social care, experience of mental health services and recommendations. ConclusionsExisting social care and mental health teams can improve the care of care-leavers navigating multiple personal, practical and service transitions. Recommendations include effective Pathway Planning, multiagency coordination, and stating who is responsible for mental health care and its coordination. Participants asked that youth mental health services span the social care transition; and provide continuity of mental health provision when care-leavers are at risk of feeling abandoned and isolated, suffering deteriorating mental health and struggling to establish new relationships with professionals. Young people say that the key to successful transition and achieving independence is maintaining trust and support from services.\", 'PurposeThis study compares the perspectives of rural and urban mental health clinicians working in various Washington State Community Health Centers that have implemented an integrated primary care/mental health program. MethodsWe conducted a Web-based survey of mental health clinicians (n = 71) who work in an integrated primary care/mental health program (the program) in 1 of 150 safety net primary care clinics in Washington State. Most participating clinics are Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health Clinics. Pooled survey results from clinicians working in rural settings were compared to those working in urban settings. Semistructured interviews were conducted with a subset (n = 32) of survey respondents. Comments made during these interviews were analyzed for themes. FindingsIn the survey phase, both rural and urban clinicians generally agreed that the program benefitted their patients. Rural respondents were particularly appreciative of the flexibility that the program offered when planning care. Not surprisingly, social service limitations (such as housing or transportation services) were more often mentioned as program limitations. Rural clinicians were more likely to note a lack of awareness of program resources among other medical providers on the team. ConclusionsClinicians working in rural primary care clinics value the availability and flexibility of an integrated primary care/mental health program as an option for providing mental health care for their patients. Clinicians working in rural settings could benefit from additional training and program implementation support to best meet the needs of their patients.', \"Background Self-rated health (SRH) is a single-item measure of current health, which is often used in community surveys and has been associated with various objective health outcomes. The prevalence and factors associated with SRH in Sub-Saharan Africa remain largely unknown. This study sought to investigate: (1) the prevalence of poor SRH, (2) possible associations between SRH, and socio-demographic and clinical parameters, and (3) associations between SRH and the patients' assessment of the quality of primary care. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 primary care facilities in Blantyre, Neno, and Thyolo districts of Malawi among 962 participants who sought care in these facilities. An interviewer-administered questionnaire containing the Malawian primary care assessment tool, and questions on socio-demographic characteristics and self-rated health was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the distribution of variables of interest and binary logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with poor SRH. Results Poor SRH was associated with female sex, increasing age, decreasing education, frequent health care attendance, and with reported disability. Patients content with the service provided and who reported higher scores of relational continuity from their health care providers reported better SRH as compared with others. Conclusion This study reports findings from a context where SRH is scarcely examined. The prevalence of poor SRH in Malawi is in line with findings from clinical populations in other countries. The associations between poor SRH and socio-demographic factors are also known from other populations. SRH might be improved by emphasizing continuity of care in primary care services.\", \"Nearly 750 000 children are currently in foster care in the United States. Recent trends in foster care include reliance on extended family members to care for children in kinship care placements, increased efforts to reduce the length of placement, acceleration of termination of parental rights proceedings, and emphasis on adoption. It is not clear what impact welfare reform may have on the number of children who may require foster care placement. Although most children enter foster care with medical, mental health, or developmental problems, many do not receive adequate or appropriate care while in placement. Psychological and emotional problems, in particular, may worsen rather than improve. Multiple barriers to adequate health care for this population exist. Health care practitioners can help to improve the health and well-being of children in foster care by performing timely and thorough admission evaluations, providing continuity of care, and playing an active advocacy role. Potential areas for health services research include study of the impact of different models of health care delivery, the role of a medical home in providing continuity of care, the perception of the foster care experience by the child, children's adjustment to foster care, and foster parent education on health outcomes.\", 'Provisions of the Affordable Care Act provide unprecedented opportunities for expanded access to behavioral health care and for redesigning the provision of services. Key to these reforms is establishing mental and substance abuse care as essential coverage, extending Medicaid eligibility and insurance parity, and protecting insurance coverage for persons with preexisting conditions and disabilities. Many provisions, including Accountable Care Organizations, health homes, and other structures, provide incentives for integrating primary care and behavioral health services and coordinating the range of services often required by persons with severe and persistent mental health conditions. Careful research and experience are required to establish the services most appropriate for primary care and effective linkage to specialty mental health services. Research providing guidance on present evidence and uncertainties is reviewed. Success in redesign will follow progress building on collaborative care and other evidence-based practices, reshaping professional incentives and practices, and reinvigorating the behavioral health workforce.', 'Primary care remains the main setting for delivery of psychiatric care. An integrated approach improves the ability of primary care providers (PCPs) to care for complex patients with behavioral health needs. This article describes integrated care and how physician associates/assistants can gain additional training to become behavioral health specialists.', 'Strengthening primary health care (PHC) is considered a priority for efficient and responsive health systems, but empirical evidence from low-and middle-income countries is limited. The stepwise introduction of family medicine across all 81 provinces of Turkey (a middle-income country) between 2005 and 2010, aimed at PHC strengthening, presents a natural experiment for assessing the effect of family medicine on health service utilization and user satisfaction. The effect of health system reforms, that introduced family medicine, on utilization was assessed using longitudinal, province-level data for 12 years and multivariate regression models adjusting for supply-side variables, demographics, socio-economic development and underlying yearly trends. User satisfaction with primary and secondary care services was explored using data from annual Life Satisfaction Surveys. Trends in preferred first point of contact (primary vs secondary, public vs. private), reason for choice and health services issues, were described and stratified by patient characteristics, provider type, and rural/urban settings. Between 2002 and 2013, the average number of PHC consultations increased from 1.75 to 2.83 per person per year. In multivariate models, family medicine introduction was associated with an increase of 0.37 PHC consultations per person (P<0.001), and slower annual growth in PHC and secondary care consultations. Following family medicine introduction, the growth of PHC and secondary care consultations per person was 0.08 and 0.30, respectively, a year. PHC increased as preferred provider by 9.5% over 7 years with the reasons of proximity and service satisfaction, which increased by 14.9% and 11.8%, respectively. Reporting of poor facility hygiene, difficulty getting an appointment, poor physician behaviour and high costs of health care all declined (P<0.001) in PHC settings, but remained higher among urban, low-income and working-age populations.', 'Integrated Health Care may possibly be a training field for efficient patient and case mangement between different providers involved. In the medium term, those instruments should be developed further so that they are no longer merely tools for cost containment, risk transfer to the providers side and competition for the good risks in health care. In the present state Integrated Health Care - as many other new regulations - means a displacement of money from health care to administration. All participants are urged to check their contracts that the benefit for patients exceeds the price of the paper.', \"Background Primary health care is a critical foundation of high-quality health systems. Health facility management has been studied in high-income countries, but there are significant measurement gaps about facility management and primary health care performance in low and middle-income countries. A primary health care facility management evaluation tool (PRIME-Tool) was initially piloted in Ghana where better facility management was associated with higher performance on select primary health care outcomes such as essential drug availability, trust in providers, ease of following a provider's advice, and overall patient-reported quality rating. In this study, we sought to understand health facility management within Uganda's decentralized primary health care system. Methods We administered and analyzed a cross-sectional household and health facility survey conducted in Uganda in 2019, assessing facility management using the PRIME-Tool. Results Better facility management was associated with better essential drug availability but not better performance on measures of stocking equipment. Facilities with better PRIME-Tool management scores trended towards better performance on a number of experiential quality measures. We found significant disparities in the management performance of primary health care facilities. In particular, patients with greater wealth and education and those living in urban areas sought care at facilities that performed better on management. Private facilities and hospitals performed better on the management index than public facilities and health centers and clinics. Conclusions These results suggest that investments in stronger facility management in Uganda may strengthen key aspects of facility readiness such as essential drug availability and potentially could affect experiential quality of care. Nevertheless, the stark disparities demonstrate that Uganda policymakers need to target investments strategically in order to improve primary health care equitably across socioeconomic status and geography. Moreover, other low and middle-income countries may benefit from the use of the PRIME-Tool to rapidly assess facility management with the goal of understanding and improving primary health care performance.\", \"Background: Hospital HIV care and public sexual health care (a Sexual Health Care Centre) services were integrated to provide sexual health counselling and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing and treatment (sexual health care) to larger numbers of HIV patients. Services, need and usage were assessed using a patient perspective, which is a key factor for the success of service integration. Methods: The study design was a one-group pre-test and post-test comparison of 447 HIV-infected heterosexual individuals and men who have sex with men (MSM) attending a hospital-based HIV centre serving the southern region of the Netherlands. The intervention offered comprehensive sexual health care using an integrated care approach. The main outcomes were intervention uptake, patients' pre-test care needs (n=254), and quality rating. Results: Pre intervention, 43% of the patients wanted to discuss sexual health (51% MSM; 30% heterosexuals). Of these patients, 12% to 35% reported regular coverage, and up to 25% never discussed sexual health topics at their HIV care visits. Of the patients, 24% used our intervention. Usage was higher among patients who previously expressed a need to discuss sexual health. Most patients who used the integrated services were new users of public health services. STIs were detected in 13% of MSM and in none of the heterosexuals. The quality of care was rated good. Conclusions: The HIV patients in our study generally considered sexual health important, but the regular counselling and testing at the HIV care visit was insufficient. The integration of public health and hospital services benefited both care sectors and their patients by addressing sexual health questions, detecting STIs, and conducting partner notification. Successful sexual health care uptake requires increased awareness among patients about their care options as well as a cultural shift among care providers.\", 'In light of increasing interest in evidence-based management, we conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) to determine the availability and accessibility of evidence for health care managers; 14 MAs and 61 SRs met the inclusion criteria. Most reviews appeared in medical journals (53%), originated in the United States (29%) or United Kingdom (22%), were hospital-based (55%), and targeted clinical providers (55%). Topics included health services organization (34%), quality/patient safety (17%), information technology (15%), organization/workplace management (13%), and health care workforce (12%). Most reviews addressed clinical topics of relevance to managers; management-related interventions were rare. The management issues were mostly classified as operational (65%). Surprisingly, 96.5% of search results were not on target. A better classification within PubMed is needed to increase the accessibility of meaningful resources and facilitate evidence retrieval. Health care journals should take initiatives encouraging the publication of reviews in relevant management areas.', 'Background: Smoking, poor nutrition, risky alcohol use, and physical inactivity are the primary behavioral risks for common causes of mortality and morbidity. Evidence and guidelines support routine clinician delivery of preventive care. Limited evidence describes the level delivered in community health settings. The objective was to determine the: prevalence of preventive care provided by community health clinicians; association between client and service characteristics and receipt of care; and acceptability of care. This will assist in informing interventions that facilitate adoption of opportunistic preventive care delivery to all clients. Methods: In 2009 and 2010 a telephone survey was undertaken of 1284 clients across a network of 56 public community health facilities in one health district in New South Wales, Australia. The survey assessed receipt of preventive care (assessment, brief advice, and referral/follow-up) regarding smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol overconsumption, and physical inactivity; and acceptability of care. Results: Care was most frequently reported for smoking (assessment: 59.9%, brief advice: 61.7%, and offer of referral to a telephone service: 4.5%) and least frequently for inadequate fruit or vegetable consumption (27.0%, 20.0% and 0.9% respectively). Sixteen percent reported assessment for all risks, 16.2% received brief advice for all risks, and 0.6% were offered a specific referral for all risks. The following were associated with increased care: diabetes services, number of appointments, being male, Aboriginal, unemployed, and socio-economically disadvantaged. Acceptability of preventive care was high (76.0%-95.3%). Conclusions: Despite strong client support, preventive care was not provided opportunistically to all, and was preferentially provided to select groups. This suggests a need for practice change strategies to enhance preventive care provision to achieve adherence to clinical guidelines.', 'Objective. To study the prevalence and possible predictors for smoking during pregnancy in Iceland. Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. Twenty-six primary health care centres in Iceland 2009 - 2010. Subjects. Women attending antenatal care in the 11th - 16th week of pregnancy were invited to participate by convenient consecutive manner, stratified according to residency. A total of 1111 women provided data in this first phase of the cohort study. Main outcome measures. Smoking habits before and during early pregnancy were assessed with a postal questionnaire, which also included questions about socio-demographic background, physical and emotional well-being, and use of medications. Results. The prevalence of smoking prior to pregnancy was 20% (223/1111). During early pregnancy, it was 5% (53/1111). In comparison with women who stopped smoking during early pregnancy, those who continued to smoke had on average a significantly lower level of education, had smoked more cigarettes per day before pregnancy, and were more likely to use nicotine replacement therapy in addition to smoking during pregnancy. A higher number of cigarettes consumed per day before pregnancy and a lower level of education were the strongest predictors for continued smoking during pregnancy. Conclusion. The majority of Icelandic women who smoke stop when they become pregnant, and the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Iceland is still about 5%. Our results indicate stronger nicotine dependence in women who do not stop smoking during pregnancy. Awareness of this can help general practitioners (GPs) and others providing antenatal care to approach these women with more insight and empathy, which might theoretically help them to quit.', 'In Norway, the Directorate of Health is responsible for two nationwide registries - the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and the Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care (NRPHC) - which together cover all governmental-funded health care. The NPR (specialist health care) was established in 2008, while the NRPHC (primary health care) was established in 2017. Data from the NPR are extensively used in a large variety of studies. We expect that data from the NRPHC will increase in importance when the registry covers a longer time period. The NRPHC will be especially important for studying conditions mainly treated in primary care and for investigation of patient trajectories. The main aim of this paper is to give an overview of the history and content of the NPR and its research possibilities. In addition, we introduce the NRPHC as a possible future research tool and the potential for studying patient trajectories when combining data from the two registries.', 'Introduction: Designing systematic, scientifically rigorous program evaluations ( PE) is 1 way to contribute to the significant need to build best practices and a stronger evidence base for integrated behavioral health care. However, there are many potential pitfalls when conducting PE in real-world settings, and many clinicians and administrators may be hesitant to engage in PE due to lack of training or resources. Rigorous PE can be achieved feasibly and efficiently. Method: This article discusses common challenges that arise when conducting PE in integrated behavioral health care settings and illustrates ways to increase the methodological quality of PE efforts using lessons learned from 2 real-world case examples. The first example included a PE of a training program for brief alcohol interventions, and the second example included a PE of a depression medication monitoring service. Results/Discussion: The case examples demonstrate the need for strategic planning beforehand, including the use of a conceptual framework as well as appropriate study designs/methodology, measurement, and the need for consistency to achieve a well-designed PE. Using the recommendations within this article, it is hoped that the quality of PEs can be improved resulting in more generalizable data that can be used to inform organizations and policymakers to improve health care delivery.', 'Massachusetts Health Reform (MHR), implemented in 2006, introduced new health insurance options that may have prompted some veterans already enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) to reduce their reliance on VA health services. This study examined whether MHR was associated with changes in VA primary care (PC) use. Using VA administrative data, we identified 147,836 veterans residing in Massachusetts and neighboring New England (NE) states from October 2004 to September 2008. We applied difference-in-difference methods to compare pre-post changes in PC use among Massachusetts and other NE veterans. Among veterans not enrolled in Medicare, VA PC use was not significantly different following MHR for Massachusetts veterans relative to other NE veterans. Among VA-Medicare dual enrollees, MHR was associated with an increase of 24.5 PC visits per 1,000 veterans per quarter (p = .048). Despite new non-VA health options through MHR, VA enrollees continued to rely on VA PC.', 'Background: Negative experiences in the health care system, including perceived discrimination, can result in patient disengagement from health care. Four million US women give birth each year, and the perinatal period is a time of sustained interaction with the health care system, but potential consequences of negative experiences have not been examined in this context. We assessed whether perceived discrimination during the birth hospitalization were associated with postpartum follow-up care. Methods: Data were from the Listening to Mothers III survey, a nationally drawn sample of 2400 women with singleton births in US hospitals in 2011-2012. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds of having a postpartum visit in the 8 weeks following birth by perceptions of discrimination due to (1) race/ethnicity; (2) insurance type; and (3) a difference of opinion with a provider about care. Results: Women who experienced any of the 3 types of perceived discrimination had more than twice the odds of postpartum visit nonattendance (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28, P = 0.001), after adjusting for socioeconomic and medical characteristics. Conclusions: The postpartum visit is an opportunity for a patient and clinician to address continuing health problems following birth, discuss contraception, and screen for chronic disease. Forgoing this care may have negative health effects. The findings from this study underscore the need to reduce discrimination and improve maternity care experiences.', \"Purpose: Private and confidential health care is an important indicator of the quality of health care for adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of health care utilization and private and confidential health care among a nationally representative population of high school students. Methods: A two-stage cluster sample of 9,107 students (grades 8-12, response rate 73%) from 96 New Zealand high schools (response rate 84%) participated in a 2007 health survey using Internet tablets. Questions included when and where they had accessed health care, if their health care provider had explained that their health care was confidential, and if they had been seen in private by their health care provider. Results: Although 83% of students had accessed health care in the previous 12 months, only 27% of students reported receiving private and confidential health care. Students who had accessed health care from a school-based health center (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence interval] 1.54 [1.42-1.66]) or family planning/sexual health clinics (adjusted relative risk = 2.1 [1.9 - 2.26]) were more likely to report receiving private and confidential health care compared with students who had not accessed health care from these settings. Conclusions: While most young people access health care from their family doctor or general practitioner's clinic, rates of private and confidential health care were low suggesting that opportunities to adequately explore and respond to important yet sensitive topics are compromised in primary care settings.

However, the extent to which the resulting patterns of utilization represent high-quality care (compared to fee-for-service products) remains controversial. The authors sought to compare patterns of ambulatory care (including how diffuse or fragmented the care patterns were) for Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries vs. Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. A serial cross-sectional study of adults (>= 18 years old) was conducted using statewide Medicaid claims from New York State for calendar years 2010-2013. Beneficiaries were required to be continuously enrolled and have >= 4 ambulatory visits for each year they contributed data, yielding a sample of more than 1 million beneficiaries per year. Beneficiaries were characterized by age, sex, and case mix. For each year, ambulatory care patterns were compared across subgroups of beneficiaries using Poisson models (for numbers of visits and providers) and bounded Tobit models (for fragmentation scores). In 2010, among those who were not dual eligible, managed care beneficiaries had on average fewer visits (10.9 visits vs. 11.4 visits [P < 0.0001]) but more providers (3.8 providers vs. 3.3 providers [P < 0.0001]) and therefore more fragmentation (0.58 vs. 0.51 [P < 0.0001]) than fee-for-service beneficiaries, adjusting for age, sex, and case mix. These patterns persisted throughout the follow-up period and in sensitivity analyses. Less utilization is not necessarily more efficient care; a smaller number of visits spread across a larger number of providers creates more challenges for care coordination.', \"Health care education is facing common challenges of the education sector, such as ageing staff, time pressures, digitalization, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is part of a larger participatory international action research titled Developing Occupational Well-Being of Health Care Teachers in Estonia, 2021-2023. The objective of the study is to describe and evaluate health care teachers' occupational well-being at the pretest phase of the action research project, as well as to describe the occupational well-being development plan and related development activities at Tallinn Health Care College. The data were collected from health care teachers by an electronical survey (n = 46, response rate 46%). The quantitative data were analysed by statistical methods and qualitative data by deductive-inductive analysis. In general, the teachers were satisfied with their physical environment. Many considered their work important, and they were also satisfied with working time arrangements. Based on the pretest results, an occupational well-being development plan was created. Improving communication and ergonomics were established as the main objectives in the development strategy. These improvement activities will be part of the college's new development plan. Various activities have been planned to promote occupational well-being. These activities have already begun as seminars on communication, bullying, and ergonomics in the workplace and home office. The information can be utilized to develop long-term occupational well-being at Tallinn Health Care College. The results and good practices can enhance decision-making and education at local, regional, national, and international levels.\", 'Objective To determine whether vertically integrated hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is associated with more efficient use of postdischarge care and better outcomes. Data Sources Medicare provider, beneficiary, and claims data from 2012 to 2014. Study Design We compared facility characteristics, quality of care, and health care use for hospital-based SNFs and virtually integrated SNFs (defined as freestanding SNFs with close referral relationships with a single hospital) relative to nonintegrated freestanding SNFs. Among patients admitted to integrated SNFs, we estimated differences in health care use and outcomes for patients originating from the parent hospital (ie, receiving vertically integrated care) versus other hospitals using linear regressions that included SNF fixed effects. We estimated bounds for our main estimates that incorporated potential omitted variables bias. Data Extraction Methods We identified hospital-based SNFs based on provider data. We defined virtually integrated SNFs based on patient flows between hospitals and SNFs. We identified SNF episodes, preceding hospital stays, patient characteristics, health care use, and patient outcomes using Medicare data. Principal Findings Consistent with prior research, integrated SNFs performed better on quality measures and health care use relative to nonintegrated SNFs (eg, hospital-based SNFs had 11-day shorter stays compared with nonintegrated SNFs adjusting for patient characteristics, P < .001). Stroke patients admitted to hospital-based SNFs from the parent hospital had shorter preceding hospital stays (adjusted difference: -1.2 days, P = .001) and shorter initial SNF stays (adjusted difference: -2.7 days, P = .049); estimates were attenuated but still robust accounting for potential omitted variables bias. For stroke patients, associations between vertically integrated care and other outcomes were either statistically insignificant or not robust to accounting for potential omitted variables bias. Conclusions Vertically integrated hospital and SNF care was associated with shorter hospital and SNF stays. However, there were few beneficial associations with other outcomes, suggesting limited coordination benefits from vertical integration.', 'Objective - To analyse the influence of rates of general practitioner visits on rates of hospitalisations. Design - Ecological cross-sectional study of factors influencing hospitalisation rates. Aggregated data on primary care centre area level. Setting - The county of - Ostergotland, Sweden, with 3 hospital districts and 41 primary health care centres, and the hospital district of Jonkoping, in the county of Jonkoping, Sweden, with 11 primary health care centres. Outcome measure - Hospitalisation rates. Results - Age, and rates of outpatient hospital visits were the most important factors explaining the variation in rates of hospitalisations between the primary health care centre areas. Hospital districts, socioeconomic factors and rates of GP visits also influenced the rates of hospitalisations. Conclusion - When evaluating the influence of primary health care on the rates of hospitalisations, both socioeconomic factors and health care structure must be taken into consideration. Doing this, the rates of GP visits correlated negatively with the rates of hospitalisations.', \"BACKGROUND: Standard indicators of quality of care have been developed in the United States. Limited information exists about quality of care in countries with universal health care coverage. OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of preventive care and care for cardiovascular risk factors in a country with universal health care coverage. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort of a random sample of 1,002 patients aged 50-80 years followed for 2 years from all Swiss university primary care settings. MAIN MEASURES: We used indicators derived from RAND's Quality Assessment Tools. Each indicator was scored by dividing the number of episodes when recommended care was delivered by the number of times patients were eligible for indicators. Aggregate scores were calculated by taking into account the number of eligible patients for each indicator. KEY RESULTS: Overall, patients (44% women) received 69% of recommended preventive care, but rates differed by indicators. Indicators assessing annual blood pressure and weight measurements (both 95%) were more likely to be met than indicators assessing smoking cessation counseling (72%), breast (40%) and colon cancer screening (35%; all p < 0.001 for comparisons with blood pressure and weight measurements). Eighty-three percent of patients received the recommended care for cardiovascular risk factors, including > 75% for hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes. However, foot examination was performed only in 50% of patients with diabetes. Prevention indicators were more likely to be met in men (72.2% vs 65.3% in women, p < 0.001) and patients < 65 years (70.1% vs 68.0% in those a parts per thousand yen65 years, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Using standardized tools, these adults received 69% of recommended preventive care and 83% of care for cardiovascular risk factors in Switzerland, a country with universal coverage. Prevention indicator rates were lower for women and the elderly, and for cancer screening. Our study helps pave the way for targeted quality improvement initiatives and broader assessment of health care in Continental Europe.\", 'Prior research has demonstrated disparities in general medical care for patients with mental health conditions, but little is known about disparities in pain care. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality (PCQ) as documented by primary care clinicians in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We used natural language processing to analyze electronic health record data from a national sample of Veterans with moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain during primary care visits in the Fiscal Year 2017. Twelve PCQ indicators were annotated from clinician progress notes as present or absent; PCQ score was defined as the sum of these indicators. Generalized estimating equation Poisson models examined associations among mental health diagnosis categories and PCQ scores. The overall mean PCQ score across 135,408 person-visits was 8.4 (SD = 2.3). In the final adjusted model, post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with higher PCQ scores (RR = 1.006, 95%CI 1.002-1.010, P = .007). Depression, alcohol use disorder, other substance use disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder diagnoses were not associated with PCQ scores. Overall, results suggest that in this patient population, presence of a mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care. Perspective: This study used a natural language processing approach to analyze medical records to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality as documented by primary care clinicians. Findings suggest that presence of a diagnosed mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care.

An accessible primary care is an important part of the solution for how to provide affordable care for the population and reduce pressure on the overall health care system such as unnecessary hospital stays and associated costs. As primary care constitutes an important first line of healthcare, the task of prioritising and deciding what to do and for whom lies in practice, primarily with the primary care professionals. Thus, the decisions and behaviour of primary care professionals have a central role in achieving good and equal health in the population. The aim of this study is to explore how primary health care professionals handle situations with limited resources and enhance our knowledge of priorities in practice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 14 health care professionals (7 nurses, 7 physicians) working in Swedish primary care were interviewed. Data were analysed inductively with content analysis. Findings: Three main categories were found: Influx of patients; Structural conditions; and Actions. Each category illustrates an important aspect for what primary care professionals do to achieve good and equal care. The influx of patients concerned what the professionals handled in terms of patients' healthcare needs and patient behaviour. Structural conditions consisted of policies and goals set for primary care, competence availability, technical systems, and organisational culture. To handle situations due to limited resources, professionals performed different actions: matching health care needs with professionals' competency, defining care needs to suit booking systems appointments, giving care at the inappropriate health care level, rearranging workhours, and passing on the decision making. Conclusion: Priorities in primary care are not, one fits all  solution. Our study shows that priorities in primary care comprise of ongoing daily processes that are adapted to the situation, context of patient influx, and structural conditions. Healthcare professional's actions for how influx of patients' is handled in relation to limited resources, are created, and shaped within this context which also sets the boundaries for their actions.\", 'ContextMassachusetts enacted health care reform in 2006 to expand insurance coverage and improve access to health care. The objective of our study was to compare trends in health status and the use of ambulatory health services before and after the implementation of health reform in Massachusetts relative to that in other New England states. MethodsWe used a quasi-experimental design with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2001 to 2011 to compare trends associated with health reform in Massachusetts relative to that in other New England states. We compared self-reported health and the use of preventive services using multivariate logistic regression with difference-in-differences analysis to account for temporal trends. We estimated predicted probabilities and changes in these probabilities to gauge the differential effects between Massachusetts and other New England states. Finally, we conducted subgroup analysis to assess the differential changes by income and race/ethnicity. FindingsThe sample included 345,211 adults aged eighteen to sixty-four. In comparing the periods before and after health care reform relative to those in other New England states, we found that Massachusetts residents reported greater improvements in general health (1.7%), physical health (1.3%), and mental health (1.5%). Massachusetts residents also reported significant relative increases in rates of Pap screening (2.3%), colonoscopy (5.5%), and cholesterol testing (1.4%). Adults in Massachusetts households that earned up to 300% of the federal poverty level gained more in health status than did those above that level, with differential changes ranging from 0.2% to 1.3%. Relative gains in health status were comparable among white, black, and Hispanic residents in Massachusetts. ConclusionsHealth care reform in Massachusetts was associated with improved health status and the greater use of some preventive services relative to those in other New England states, particularly among low-income households. These findings may stem from expanded insurance coverage as well as innovations in health care delivery that accelerated after health reform.', \"This position paper aims to increase awareness among primary care practitioners and policymakers about the specific and complex health needs of people who experience incarceration. We focus on the importance of primary care and of continuity of care between prison and community. We highlight what is known from the literature on the health of people who experience incarceration, on the organisation of prison health care, and on the role of primary care both during and after detention. We present three case descriptions of detainees' encounters with the organisation of prison health care in three European countries. Finally, we describe the position that the European Forum for Primary Care takes. Prisoners and ex-prisoners have a worse physical and mental health compared with a cross-section of the population. However, access to good quality treatment and care is often worse than in the outside situation. In particular, well-organised primary care in the prison context could benefit prisoners and, indirectly, society at large. Moreover, continuity of care between the community and the prison situation needs improvement.\", 'Facing escalating health care expenditures, the governments of countries with national health insurance programs are trying to control or even to reduce health care utilization. Little research has examined the effects of decreased health care utilization on health outcomes. Applying a natural experiment design to the Taiwan population between 2000 and 2004, which includes the 2003 SARS epidemic when an average 20% decline in health care utilization occurred, this study examines the association between a decline in health care utilization and health outcomes measured by cause-specific mortality rates. We analyse the monthly mortality rates caused by infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus, nervous system diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, heart and other vascular diseases, respiratory system diseases, digestive system diseases, genitourinary system diseases and accidents. Models control for age, sex, month and year effects. Results show the heterogeneous effect of reduced health care utilization on health outcomes. Patients with diabetes mellitus or cerebrovascular diseases are vulnerable to short-term reductions in health care; compared with the non-SARS period, mortality caused by diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular diseases significantly increased during the SARS epidemic by 8.4% and 6.2%, respectively. No significant change in mortality rates caused by the other diseases or accidents is found. This study suggests that governments of countries where health care utilization and spending are similar to or inferior to those in Taiwan should carefully evaluate the impact of policies that attempt to reduce health care utilization. Furthermore, when an area encounters an epidemic, governments should be aware of the negative consequences of voluntary restraints on access to health care that accompany decreases in utilization.', \"Evaluate health care access and experiences with care among long-term survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer relative to a comparison group in the USA. The 2008 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys identified 1163 survivors of cancer, diagnosed ages 15-39, current ages 20-64, who were at least 5 years after diagnosis. A comparison group without cancer was matched using age, sex, and other characteristics. Primary outcomes included having a parts per thousand yen1 visit to doctor's office/clinic in the previous year and perceived health care quality (0 = worst to 10 = best; categorized as low (0-4), intermediate (5-7), and high (8-10)). Other experience-related outcomes (e.g., having adequate time with providers and providers show respect) were also evaluated. Bivariate analyses compared these outcomes between survivors and the comparison group. Multivariable logistic regressions identified survivor-level factors associated with health care visits and quality. Survivors had a parts per thousand yen1 visit more often (82.1 vs. 75.8 %, p = 0.005) yet rated their health care quality lower (low or intermediate 30.7 vs. 23.6 %, p < 0.001) than the comparison group. Fewer survivors reported always having enough time with providers (41.7 vs. 54.6 %, p < 0.001) and that providers always show respect (57.5 vs. 67.7 %, p = 0.002). Uninsured survivors were less likely to have a parts per thousand yen1 visit (odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.40, p < 0.001) and rated their health care quality lower (OR = 0.25, 95 % CI 0.13-0.48, p < 0.001) than privately insured. Many other factors were associated with visits and quality. Survivors of AYA cancer reported more health care visits but worse health care experiences than individuals without cancer. Targeted interventions that may improve survivors' experiences with health care should be evaluated.\", \"Introduction: This study examined the perspectives of pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) regarding the needs of adolescents, parents/caregivers, clinicians, and institutions in the health care transition (HCT) process for adolescents/young adults. Methods: PNPs (N = 170) participated in a luncheon for those interested in transition at an annual conference. Small groups discussed and recorded their perspectives related to health care transition from adolescent to adult services. Content analysis was used to analyze responses (Krippendorff, 2013). Results: Four themes, Education, Health care system, Support, and Communication, emerged from the data analysis. PNPs identified health care informatics and adolescents' use of technology as additional critical aspects to be considered in health care transition. Discussion: Opportunities and challenges identified by the PNPs are discussed to improve the quality and process of transitioning adolescents to adult services. This report will help National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners formulate a new Health Care Transition Policy Statement for the organization.\", 'The annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports document widespread and persistent racial and ethnic disparities. These disparities result from complex interactions between patient factors related to social disadvantage, clinicians, and organizational and health care system factors. Separate and unequal systems of health care between states, between health care systems, and between clinicians constrain the resources that are available to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups, contribute to unequal outcomes, and reinforce implicit bias. Recent data suggest slow progress in many areas but have documented a few notable successes in eliminating these disparities. To eliminate these disparities, continued progress will require a collective national will to ensure health care equity through expanded health insurance coverage, support for primary care, and public accountability based on progress toward defined, time-limited objectives using evidence-based, sufficiently resourced, multilevel quality improvement strategies that engage patients, clinicians, health care organizations, and communities.', \"This article explores the complexity of a health care system reforms in a post-conflict situation. It describes how the health care system was revamped immediately after the war, and then reorganized with Primary Health Care (PHC) as the fulcrum for change. It highlights the coordination problems, typical of a post-war situation when un-coordinated humanitarian assistance pours in. From the vantage points of Ministry of Health officials, the article details how the change process has gone over the years, the directions it has taken and the lessons learnt. It notes that reforms are often so fast that they outstrip the absorption capacity of the potential change agents because of their inadequate preparation for the new roles and responsibilities. This in turn threatens to undermine and weaken the very system that the reforms seek to strengthen. Several options adopted for change in Kosovo's health care system are at varying levels of implementation today. Some commentators have questioned if the policy for the new health care system has failed. We contend that there have been major organizational successes. But there are also shortcomings. There is also a potential danger that the health care system could partly revert to the old system. While some of the successes and shortcomings may be specific to Kosovo, many lessons learnt from Kosovo apply to health care reforms elsewhere.\", 'There is little or no role for primary care and family medicine in current health reforms in Mexico. However, robust evidence shows that primary care helps prevent morbidity and mortality and increases health equity. Mexico has participated in several international meetings sponsored by the World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations and the North American Primary Care Research Group that are aimed at increased understanding of national health systems and the need to strengthen primary care for improved health outcomes. From 1 of these meetings the Cancun Manifesto emerged, with a strategic plan to increase the stature and impact of the Mexican College of Family Physicians (COLMEXAC) in strengthening primary care in Mexico. We aim to describe this strategic plan and discuss its early implementation, and for this account to serve as a possible formula for other countries. The 5 specific strategies discussed are 1) the need for consensus on the leading role of the Mexican family physician in the national health system; 2) health ecology research; 3) to improve the perception of patients about the benefits of primary care and family medicine; 4) to organize meetings of health providers, users, and other stakeholders; and 5) to promote the professionalization of COLMEXAC as a legal entity.', \"Background: Despite the implementation of a mandatory health insurance (MHI) scheme in Togo since 2011, its coverage rate remains low, resulting in a high out-of-pocket payment rate. More than 10 years after its implementation, there are few empirical studies investigating the extent to which Togo's mandatory health insurance has improved beneficiaries' access to health care. Examining how MHI and healthcare use in Togo are related is the goal of this study. Methods: We use data from the Harmonized Survey on Living Conditions of Households (EHCVM), conducted in the member states of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) in 2018-2019 and covering 6,171 households in Togo. We employ multinomial logistic regression, given that the dependent variable is polytomous. Results: The results reveal a high rate of non-utilization of healthcare professionals in the case of illness, even among individuals with MHI coverage. Furthermore, the findings show that the MHI increases the likelihood of seeing a specialist physician and other formal health care professionals when sick. The results also reveal that a household's wealth is positively correlated with the likelihood of seeing formal health care professionals. Urban residents are statistically and significantly more likely than rural residents to see both a specialist physician and a general practitioner. The Grand Lome region has a statistically and significantly higher likelihood of seeing a specialist physician than the Maritime region. Conclusion :The results support the government's plan to implement universal health insurance. The government should take action to raise the standard of treatment provided to insured patients in health care centers. Additionally, the government should consider waiving medical fees for low-income policyholders. When waiving medical costs for low-income policyholders, the Togolese government should focus on the regions with the worst economic conditions. These interventions should be essential to ensure that no one is left behind. The difference between urban and rural communities should be reduced through supply-side policies that focus on rural areas.\", 'Background: There is increasing recognition in Canada and globally that a substantial proportion of health care delivered is inappropriate as evidenced by (1) harmful and/or ineffective practices being overused, (2) effective clinical practices being underused, and (3) other clinical practices being misused. Inappropriate health care leads to negative patient experiences, poor health outcomes, and inefficient use of scarce health care resources. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of inappropriate health care in Canada. Our specific objectives are to (1) systematically search and critically review published and grey literature for studies on inappropriate health care in Canada; (2) estimate the nature and magnitude of inappropriate health care in Canada and its provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Methods: We will include all quantitative study designs reporting objective or subjective measurements of inappropriate health care in Canada over the last 10 years. We will search the following online databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EconLit, and ISI-Web of Knowledge, which contains Web of Science Core Collection-Citation Indexes, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities. We will also search grey literature sources to identify provincial and national audits of inappropriate health care. Two authors will independently screen, assess data quality, and extract data for synthesis. Study findings will be synthesized narratively. We will organize our data into three care categorizations: preventive care, acute care, and chronic care. We will provide a compendium of inappropriate health care for each care category for Canada and each Canadian province and territory, where sufficient data exists, by calculating (1) overall medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse of clinical practices and (2) the range of medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse for each clinical practice investigated. Discussion: This review will result in the first-ever evidence-based compendium of inappropriate health care in Canada. We will also develop detailed reports of inappropriate health care for each Canadian province and territory.', 'Background: There are significant health status inequalities in Australia between those people living in rural and remote locations and people living in metropolitan centres. Since almost ninety percent of the population use some form of primary health care service annually, a logical initial step in reducing the disparity in health status is to improve access to health care by specifying those primary health care services that should be considered as core and therefore readily available to all Australians regardless of where they live. A systematic review was undertaken to define these core services. Using the question What primary health care services should residents of rural and remote Australia be able to access?, the objective of this paper is to delineate those primary health care core services that should be readily available to all regardless of geography. Method: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from established databases was undertaken. Relevant websites were also searched for grey literature. Key informants were accessed to identify other relevant reference material. All papers were assessed by at least two assessors according to agreed inclusion criteria. Results: Data were extracted from 19 papers (7 papers from the peer-reviewed database search and 12 from other grey sources) which met the inclusion criteria. The 19 papers demonstrated substantial variability in both the number and nature of core services. Given this variation, the specification or synthesis of a universal set of core services proved to be a complex and arguably contentious task. Nonetheless, the different primary health care dimensions that should be met through the provision of core services were developed. In addition, the process of identifying core services provided important insights about the need to deliver these services in ways that are fit-for-purpose in widely differing geographic contexts. Conclusions: Defining a suite of core primary health care services is a difficult process. Such a suite should be fit-for-purpose, relevant to the context, and its development should be methodologically clear, appropriate, and evidence-based. The value of identifying core PHC services to both consumers and providers for service planning and monitoring and consequent health outcomes is paramount.', 'Unsustainable development around the world has contributed to ecological degradation and human suffering while compromising the ability of ecosystems and social institutions to support human life. The United States health care system and its institutions are significant contributors to unsustainable development, but leaders of change are emerging from the health care arena. Health professionals, including primary care providers, are poised to serve as models for sustainability and to facilitate the necessary transformation toward more sustainable practices. Health professionals must, within a practical framework, embrace an objective definition of sustainability and then act to achieve it.', 'Purpose: The integration of mental health specialists into primary care has been widely advocated to deliver evidence-based mental health care to a defined population while improving access, clinical outcomes, and cost efficiency. Integrated care has been infrequently and inconsistently translated into real-world settings; as a result, the key individual components of effective integrated care remain unclear. Method: This article reports findings from a qualitative study that explored provider and client experiences of integrated care. We conducted in-depth interviews with integrated care providers (n = 13) and clients (n = 9) to understand their perspectives and experiences of integrated care including recommended areas for quality measurement and improvement. The authors used qualitative content and reflexive thematic analytic approaches to synthesize the interview data. Results: Clients and integrated care providers agreed regarding the overarching concepts of the what, how, and why of integrated care including co-location of care; continuity of care; team composition and functioning; client centeredness; and comprehensive care for individuals and populations. Providers and clients proposed a number of dimensions that could be the focus for quality measurement and evaluation, illuminating what is needed for successful context-sensitive spreading and scaling of integrated care interventions. Conclusion: With a mounting gap between the empirical support for integrated care approaches and the implementation of these models, there is a need to clarify the aims of integrated care and the key ingredients required for widespread implementation outside of research settings. This study has important implications for future integrated care research, and health care provider and client engagement in the quality movement.', 'OBJECTIVE: Material hardships, defined as difficulty meeting basic needs, are associated with adverse child health outcomes, including suboptimal health care utilization. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) may be more vulnerable to the effects of hardships. Our objective was to determine associations between material hardships and health care utilization among CSHCN. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study surveying caregivers of 2- to 12-year-old CSHCN in a low-income, urban area. Independent variables were parent-reported material hardships: difficulty paying bills, food insecurity, housing insecurity, and health care hardship. Dependent variables were parent-reported number of emergency department (ED) visits, any hospital admission, and any unmet health care need. We used negative binomial and logistic regression to assess for associations between each hardship and each outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 205 caregivers between July 2017 and May 2018 and analyzed the data in 2018. After adjustment, difficulty paying bills (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.12) and health care hardship (IRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.75) were associated with higher rates of ED visits. There were no associations between hardships and hospital admission. Difficulty paying bills (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.98), food insecurity (AOR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.02-3.71), and housing insecurity (AOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.36-5.40) were associated with higher odds of unmet health care need. CONCLUSIONS: Material hardships were associated with higher rates of ED visits and greater unmet health care need among low-income CSHCN. Future examination of the mechanisms of these associations is needed to enhance support for families of CSHCN.', 'Background We aim to investigate the costs associated with growth in the administrators, health care staff, and physicians to provide direction to establish a sustainable and cost-effective U.S. health care system. Methods Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, particularly the Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, were utilized from 2009 to 2020. Wages and employment of medical and health service managers (administrators), health care practitioners and technical operations (health care staff), and physicians were used to calculate the total cost. Results Administrator wages have grown similarly to health care staff wages (-4.40 vs -3.01%, P = .454) and physician wages (-4.40 vs -3.29%, P = .672). Additionally, there has been a similar increase in health care staff employment (9.91 vs 14.23%, P = .269) and physician employment (9.91 vs 15.35%, P = .252) compared to administrator employment. Overall, the total growth in administrator cost is similar to the growth in total health care staff cost (6.23 vs 11.80, P = .104) and total physician cost (6.23 vs 13.02%, P = .079). In 2020, physicians had the highest employment growth but the smallest wage increase. Conclusion Although health care staff experienced a greater percent growth in employment and cost per employee than administrators since 2009, the cost per administrator remains greater than that of health care staff. Understanding differences in wages and costs is essential to reduce health care spending without compromising access, delivery, and quality of health care services.', \"Background Effective deployment of AI tools in primary health care requires the engagement of practitioners in the development and testing of these tools, and a match between the resulting AI tools and clinical/system needs in primary health care. To set the stage for these developments, we must gain a more in-depth understanding of the views of practitioners and decision-makers about the use of AI in primary health care. The objective of this study was to identify key issues regarding the use of AI tools in primary health care by exploring the views of primary health care and digital health stakeholders. Methods This study utilized a descriptive qualitative approach, including thematic data analysis. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with primary health care and digital health stakeholders in Ontario. NVivo software was utilized in the coding of the interviews. Results Five main interconnected themes emerged: (1) Mismatch Between Envisioned Uses and Current Reality-denoting the importance of potential applications of AI in primary health care practice, with a recognition of the current reality characterized by a lack of available tools; (2) Mechanics of AI Don't Matter: Just Another Tool in the Toolbox- reflecting an interest in what value AI tools could bring to practice, rather than concern with the mechanics of the AI tools themselves; (3) AI in Practice: A Double-Edged Sword-the possible benefits of AI use in primary health care contrasted with fundamental concern about the possible threats posed by AI in terms of clinical skills and capacity, mistakes, and loss of control; (4) The Non-Starters: A Guarded Stance Regarding AI Adoption in Primary Health Care-broader concerns centred on the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI use in primary health care; and (5) Necessary Elements: Facilitators of AI in Primary Health Care-elements required to support the uptake of AI tools, including co-creation, availability and use of high quality data, and the need for evaluation. Conclusion The use of AI in primary health care may have a positive impact, but many factors need to be considered regarding its implementation. This study may help to inform the development and deployment of AI tools in primary health care.\", 'Objective: to map the available evidence on the main topics investigated in palliative care in primary health care. Method: scoping review type study carried out in five databases, including original articles, based on the descriptors palliative care, palliative care at the end of life, terminal care, terminal state, primary health care and their respective acronyms and synonyms, totaling 18 publications. The extraction of data from primary studies was performed using an instrument produced by the authors and which allowed the construction of the categories presented. Results: 18 publications were included in this review. Among the most studied themes are the difficulties of the teams regarding the continuity of care in the health network; the importance of in-service education by the multidisciplinary team; professional unpreparedness; bioethics; the validation and application of scales for prognosis and care for some pathologies such as cancer and diabetes; among others. Conclusion: it became evident that palliative care in primary health care has been gradually developed, but it is necessary to consider the organization of primary health care and the social policies that support or weaken it, being considered a complex challenge.', 'The health care system of the Arkhangelsk region experiences numerous difficulties. Insufficient financing, budget deficit, social tension negatively affect the health status of the population. Low birth-rate and high death-rate result in the decrease of population in number. A big number of traumas in men at the able-bodied age conditions the death-rate increase. The epidemiological situation in the region is Setting worse. It mostly refers to tuberculosis, syphilis, scabies, mental disorders, oncological diseases. The indices of the health status of children worsens. The main shortcomings of the present health care system are caused by insufficient out - patient medical aid and predominance of costly in-patient treatment. The draft of the programme on regional policy in health care, the tasks and the main trends of the reform of health care system in the Arkhangelsk region are presented for consideration.', \"Health care reform in Vermont promotes patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) and multi-disciplinary community health teams to support population health. This qualitative study describes the expansion of Vermont's health care reform efforts, initially focused on adult primary care, to pediatrics through interviews with project managers and facilitators, CHT members, pediatric practitioners and care coordinators, and community-based providers. Analyses used grounded theory, identifying themes confirmed by repeat occurrence across respondents. Respondents believed that PCMH recognition and financial and community supports would improve care for pediatric patients and families. Respondents shared three main challenges with health care reform efforts: achieving PCMH recognition, adapting community health teams for pediatric patients and families, and defining roles for care coordinators. For health care reform efforts to support pediatric patients and be family-centered, states may need additional resources to understand how pediatric and adult primary care differ and how best to support pediatrics during health care reform efforts.\", 'The precondition for implementation of decentralisation in health care is the education and empowerment of medical professionals and local politicians for management and decision-making. The decentralisation in health care has to be planned to suit the needs of regions and population (bottom-up), and not to follow the uniform model devised by the central government. The processes of decentralisation can have a negative effect on the quality of health care, increase prices and emphasise inequity in health. The poorly managed decentralisation can slow down the development and block the changes.', \"One strategy to promote workforce well-being has been health incentive plans, in which a company's insured employees are offered compensation for completing a particular health-related activity. In 2015, Providence Health & Services adopted an Advance Care Planning (ACP) activity as a 2015-2016 health incentive option. More than 51,000 employees and their insured relatives chose the ACP incentive option. More than 80% rated the experience as helpful or very helpful. A high proportion (95%) of employees responded that they had someone they trusted who could make medical care decisions for them, yet only 23% had completed an advance directive, and even fewer (11%) had shared the document with their health care provider. The most common reason given for not completing an advance directive was that health care providers had never asked about it. These findings suggest that an insured employee incentive plan can encourage ACP consistent with the health care organizations' values and strategic priorities.\", 'The literature highlights that disparities in health care performance exist. Publicly reporting data about disparities at an actionable level is needed. The Minnesota Health Care Disparities Report is designed to publicly report medical group health care performance rates for patients enrolled in state/federally funded programs. In addition, differences between patients enrolled in state-funded public programs and those in private or Medicare programs at statewide and medical group levels are presented. The endeavor is a cooperative one between Minnesota Community Measurement, an independent nonprofit community organization, and the Minnesota Department of Human Services, the state Medicaid agency. Public reporting makes transparent the gaps in the delivery of health care between patients enrolled in these programs at a medical group level and can facilitate quality improvement locally, where accountability lies and actions to address disparities can occur.', 'The Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded health care coverage and recognizes mental health as a major priority. However, individuals suffering from mental health disorders still face layered barriers to receiving health care, especially Asian Americans. Integration of behavioral health services within primary care is a viable way of addressing underutilization of mental health services. This paper provides insight into a comprehensive care approach integrating behavioral health services into primary care to address underutilization of mental health services in the Asian American population. True integration of behavioral health services into primary care will require financial support and payment reform to address multi-disciplinary care needs and optimize care coordination, as well as training and workforce development early in medical and mental health training programs to develop the skills that aid prevention, early identification, and intervention. Funding research on evidence-based practice oriented to the Asian American population needs to continue.', \"ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of China's health-care reform from 2009 to 2011 by examining Chinas annual health-care workforce statistics of 2008 and 2011. DesignThe design of the study was a secondary data analysis. Main outcome measureThe main outcome measure used was the Primary Health Care Worker Accessibility Index (PHCWA). ResultsThe statistics illustrated the impact health-care reform had on the provision of primary health care in rural areas. The results showed that the health-care reform of 2009 generally improved access to the primary health-care workforce in all 28 areas (range of increase: 13.18-324.0%). However, an increasing disparity in regional health care based on the increase of the standard deviations of PHCWA (range of increase: 36.44-77.10%) may be an issue that policy-makers and analysts will have to face. ConclusionsConcerted policy efforts from both the provincial and central governments are needed to narrow the gaps. Regional development should not only focus on the economic aspect, but also account for the fact that the adequate provision of primary health care is part of the infrastructure that makes development possible and sustainable.\", \"This paper introduces this mini-series on vertical equity in health care. It reflects on the fact that by and large equity policies in health care have failed and that there is a need for positive discrimination to promote equity better in future. This positive discrimination is examined under the heading of `vertical equity'. The paper considers Varian's notion of 'envy' as a basis for equity in health care but concludes that this is not a helpful route to go down. Better it would seem to pursue the idea from Sen of 'freedoms' and 'communitarian claims' (as raised previously by this author). While it is argued that procedural justice is to be preferred in the longer run as a basis for equity there are gains in adopting a short run goal of promoting distributive justice. Some preliminary evidence is presented on the weighting of health gains to reflect such vertical equity concerns.\", 'BACKGROUNDAn asymmetrical oral disease burden is endured by certain population subgroups, particularly children and adolescents. Reducing oral health disparities requires understanding multiple oral health perspectives, including those of adolescents. This qualitative study explores oral health perceptions and dental care behaviors among rural adolescents. METHODSSemistructured individual interviews with 100 rural, minority, low socioeconomic status adolescents revealed their current perceptions of oral health and dental care access. Respondents age ranged from 12 to 18 years. The sample was 80% black and 52% male. RESULTSPerceived threat from dental disease was low. Adolescents perceived regular brushing and flossing as superseding the need for preventive care. Esthetic reasons were most often cited as reasons to seek dental care. Difficulties accessing dental care include finances, transportation, fear, issues with Medicaid coverage and parental responsibility. In general, adolescents and their parents are in need of information regarding the importance of preventive dental care. CONCLUSIONSFindings illuminate barriers to dental care faced by low-income rural adolescents and counter public perceptions of government-sponsored dental care programs as being free or without cost. The importance of improved oral health knowledge, better access to care, and school-based dental care is discussed.']\n"

      "['The oral health of older people living in residential aged care facilities has been widely recognised as inadequate. The aim of this paper is to identify barriers to effective engagement of health-care providers in oral care in residential aged care facilities. A literature review was conducted using MEDline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete and PsychInfo between 2000 and 2013, with a grey literature search of government and non-government organisation policy papers, conference proceedings and theses. Keywords included: dental/oral care, residential aged care, health-care providers, barriers, constraints, and limitations. A thematic framework was used to synthesise the literature according to a series of oral health-care provision barriers, health-care provider barriers, and cross-sector collaborative barriers. A range of system, service and practitioner level barriers were identified that could impede effective communication/collaboration between different health-care providers, residents and carers regarding oral care, and these were further impeded by internal barriers at each level. Findings indicated several areas for investigation and consideration regarding policy and practice improvements. While further research is required, some key areas should be addressed if oral health care in residential aged care services is to be improved.', 'This paper explores how one health care purchasing coalition in Minnesota, the Buyers Health Care Action Group (BHCAG), has taken an active role in restructuring its local health care market. BHCAG started with the belief that the consumer should be the motivating force in health care delivery. Unfortunately, providing consumers with the information and incentives they need to make informed, effective health care decisions has triggered numerous problems. This paper examines groups of providers who network to form care systems, and explores the roles of consumers, employers, and health plans in the current market. It identifies specific methods for gathering data and distributing information to the consumer, and discusses the problems associated with attempting to implement quality improvement, as well as the questions that arise when the market does not support those improvements.', \"Introduction: Having a health care home has been shown to be associated with positive health outcomes for children with special health care needs (CSHCN), but its relationship to parental coping has not been established. The purpose of this study was to explore the health care home as a process of care related to parental coping with day-to-day demands of raising a CSHCN. Method: Data are from a sample of 18,352 CSHCN in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. Using the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as a framework, this secondary analysis explored relationships between child and household factors and parental coping among CSHCN with and without a health care home. Results: CSHCN in a health care home were more likely to have parents who were coping well. Parents who received sufficient care coordination were more satisfied with provider communication, and those who reported that care was family-centered reported better coping. Discussion: Results suggest that the health care home represents a process of care that may help families manage the daily demands of caring for CSHCN through family-centered care, provider-to-provider communication, and provision of care coordination. J Pediatr Health Care. (2012) 26, 266-275.\", 'The role of health care inequalities in social inequalities in health should be reconsidered since the quality of health care varies according to the social status. Some of the health care inequalities are constructed by not taking account of health inequalities in the development of programs or recommendations of medical practice and thus ending up with management procedures that do not reduce inequalities to a minimum but even contribute to increasing them. Other health care inequalities are due to omission, linked to the operating inertia of a health care system that does not recognize these inequalities and has no plan to catch them up. To reverse this situation it seems necessary to act at the three levels of the health care system: to change the clinical paradigm at the micro level, tackle the organizations issues at the meso level, and pursue the reform of the entire health care system at the macro level.

Materials and Methods: Pilot, prospective cohort study of 50 surrogates of adult, mechanically ventilated patients surveyed on days 1, 3, and 7 of ICU admission. Results: Responses on the Health Care System Distrust Scale on day 1 ranged from 9 to 34 (possible range 9-45, with higher scores indicating more distrust), with a mean and SD of 20.3 +/- 6.9. Factor analysis demonstrated a 2-factor structure, corresponding to the domains of values and competence. Cronbach alpha for the overall scale was .83, for the competence subscale, .76, and for the values subscale, .74. Health-care system distrust was inversely correlated with trust in ICU physicians (Pearson coefficient - .63). When evaluated over the course of each patient's ICU stay, health-care system distrust ratings decreased by 0.31 per patient-day (95% CI 0.55-0.06, P = .015). Correlation between health-care system distrust and trust in ICU physicians decreased slightly over time. Conclusions: Among surrogates in the ICU, the Health Care System Distrust Scale has high internal consistency and convergent validity. There was substantial variability in surrogates' trust in the healthcare system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recommendations were developed and refined based on expert input, evidence review, and stakeholder engagement. Participating stakeholders included experts from academia, health care organizations, industry, and government.Study DesignExpert group consensus, informed by stakeholder engagement and targeted evidence review.Data Collection/Extraction MethodsPriority themes were derived iteratively through (1) brainstorming and idea reduction, (2) targeted evidence review of candidate themes, (3) determination of preliminary themes; (4) input on preliminary themes from stakeholders attending AHRQ's 2022 Health Equity Summit; and (5) and refinement of themes based on that input. The final set of research and action recommendations was determined by authors' consensus.Principal FindingsHealth care delivery systems have contributed to racial and ethnic disparities in health care. High quality research is needed to inform health care delivery systems approaches to undo systemic barriers and inequities. We identified six priority themes for research; (1) institutional leadership, culture, and workforce; (2) data-driven, culturally tailored care; (3) health equity targeted performance incentives; (4) health equity-informed approaches to health system consolidation and access; (5) whole person care; (6) and whole community investment. We also suggest cross-cutting themes regarding research workforce and research timelines.ConclusionsAs the nation's primary health services research agency, AHRQ can advance equitable delivery of health care by funding research and disseminating evidence to help transform the organization and delivery of health care.\", \"The objective was to estimate the association between health care expenditures and implementation of preventive mental health programs by local health departments (LHDs). Multilevel nationally representative data sets were linked to test the hypothesis that LHDs' provision of preventive mental health programs was associated with cost savings. A generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution and state-fixed effects was used to estimate the association between LHDs' mental illness prevention services and total health care expenditures per person per year for adults aged 18 years and older. The main outcome measure was the annual total health care expenditure per person. The findings indicated that LHD provision of population-based prevention of mental illness was associated with an $824 reduction (95% confidence interval: -$1,562.94 to -$85.42, P < 0.05) in annual health care costs per person, after controlling for individual, LHD, community, and state characteristics. LHDs can play a critical role in establishing an integrated health care model. Their impact, however, has often been underestimated or neglected. Results showed that a small investment in LHDs may yield substantial cost savings at the societal level. The findings of this research are critical to inform policy decisions for the expansion of the Public Health 3.0 infrastructure.\", \"Purpose: This qualitative descriptive study explored Jordanian health care providers' perceptions of the health care that they provide for post-partum mothers. Methods: Thirty Jordanian health care providers (physicians, nurses and midwives) participated in three focus group discussions. A content analysis approach was used to analyse the data as appropriate for descriptive qualitative inquiry. Findings: Health care providers indicated that the care they deliver includes breastfeeding, family planning, childcare and laboratory tests. Health care providers reflected confidence in the care given but indicated the need for continuing education, more resources and expressions of appreciation. Conclusions: Findings provide insights into Jordanian health care providers' perspectives on post-partum health care and emphasized the importance of enhancing utilization of such care in Jordan. It is suggested that the Jordanian Ministry of Health develop a comprehensive plan of educational offerings for providers, with a standardized educational programme for post-partum women. It is essential that all health care facilities provide high-quality post-partum health care that meets the needs of the maternal/infant dyad. Like all qualitative descriptive studies, generalizability of the results may be limited to similar Situations and cultures.\", 'The objective of this study is to examine the causal effect of health care utilization on unmet health care needs. An IV approach deals with the endogeneity between the use of health care services and unmet health care, using the presence of drug insurance and the number of physicians by health region as instruments. We employ three cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey confidential master files (2003, 2005, and 2014). We find a robustly negative relationship between health care use and unmet health care needs. One more visit to a medical doctor on average decreases the probability of reporting unmet health care needs by 0.014 points. The effect is negative for the women-only group whereas it is statistically insignificant for men; similarly, the effect is negative for urban dwellers but insignificant for rural ones. Health care use reduces the likelihood of reporting unmet health care. Policies that encourage the use of health care services, like increasing the coverage of public drug insurance and increasing after hours accessibility of physicians, can help reduce the likelihood of unmet health care.', 'The United States is one of a very few high-income countries that does not guarantee every person the right to health care. Residents of the United States pay more out-of-pocket for increasingly worse outcomes. People of color, those who have lower incomes, and those who live in rural areas have less access to health care and are therefore at even greater risk for poor health. Universal health care, a term for various models of health care systems that provide care for every resident of a given country, will help move the United States toward higher quality, more affordable, and more equitable care. This article defines a reproductive justice and human rights foundation for universal health care, explores how health insurance has worked historically in the United States, identifies the economic reasons for implementing universal health care, and discusses international models that could be used domestically.', \"Introduction: Although recent health care reforms will expand insurance coverage for U. S. children, disparities regarding access to pediatric care persist, even among the insured. We investigated the separate and combined effects of having health insurance and a usual source of care (USC) on children's receipt of health care services. Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of the nationally representative 2002-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from children (<= 18 years of age) who had at least one health care visit and needed any additional care, tests, or treatment in the preceding year (n = 20,817). Results: Approximately 88.1% of the study population had both a USC and insurance; 1.1% had neither one; 7.6% had a USC only, and 3.2% had insurance only. Children with both insurance and a USC had the fewest unmet needs. Among insured children, those with no USC had higher rates of unmet needs than did those with a USC. Discussion: Expansions in health insurance are essential; however, it is also important for every child to have a USC. New models of practice could help to concurrently achieve these goals.

Method: A scoping review was performed. First, relevant studies were identified in 4 databases (n = 74). Independent reviewers selected eligible studies. Numerical and thematic analyses were performed to draft a preliminary framework including a definition. Next, the feasibility of the framework and definition was explored by physical therapy primary health care organization experts. Results: Numerical and thematic data on health care quality and context-specific performance resulted in a health care value framework for physical therapy primary health care organizations-including a definition of health care value, namely to continuously attain physical therapy primary health care organization-centered outcomes in coherence with patient- and stakeholder-centered outcomes, leveraged by an organization's capacity for change. Conclusion: Prior literature mainly discussed health care quality and context-specific performance for primary health care organizations separately. The current study met the need for a value-based framework, feasible for physical therapy primary health care organizations, which are for a large part micro or small. It also solves the omissions of incoherent literature and existing frameworks on continuous health care quality and context-specific performance. Future research is recommended on longitudinal exploration of the HV (health care value) framework.\", 'Informal care by adult children is a common form of long-term care for older adults and can reduce medical expenditures if it substitutes for formal care. We address how informal care by all children affects formal care, which is critically important given demographic trends and the many policies proposed to promote informal care. We examine the 1998 Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and 1995 Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest-Old Panel Survey (AHEAD) using two-part utilization models. Instrumental variables (IV) estimation controls for the simultaneity of informal and formal care. Informal care reduces home health care use and delays nursing home entry. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.', 'Introduction: A growing number of people are living with complex care needs characterized by multimorbidity, mental health challenges and social deprivation. Required is the integration of health and social care, beyond traditional health care services to address social determinants. This study investigates key care components to support complex patients and their families in the community. Methods: Expert panel focus groups with 24 care providers, working in health and social care sectors across Toronto, Ontario, Canada were conducted. Patient vignettes illustrating significant health and social care needs were presented to participants. The vignettes prompted discussions on i) how best to meet complex care needs in the community and ii) the barriers to delivering care to this population. Results: Categories to support care needs of complex patients and their families included i) relationships as the foundation for care, ii) desired processes and structures of care, and iii) barriers and workarounds for desired care. Discussion and Conclusions: Meeting the needs of the population who require health and social care requires time to develop authentic relationships, broadening the membership of the care team, communicating across sectors, co-locating health and social care, and addressing the barriers that prevent providers from engaging in these required practices.', \"Objectives. To describe the health care system and health care delivery in Greenland. Study design and method. This was a literature study that included literature and articles searched in PubMed published from 1989 to 2009 about health care in Greenland. Results. The health care system is a publicly financed governmental responsibility. Its major challenges are limited economic resources, Greenland's demographic structure, rapid epidemiological changes, increased public demand for specialized treatment, difficulty in recruiting professionals and the economic burden imposed by around-the-clock maintenance of specialized staff in sparsely populated areas. To meet these challenges, a public health program focusing on health promotion and prevention, educational initiatives to improve recruitment and a system reorientation moving towards larger health care regions is proposed to be gradually implemented from 2010. One fundamental component of this plan is tying the system together with a telemedicine system and in the future also with a joint electronic patient file system. The importance of better surveillance and monitoring of health has been recognized, while securing best clinical practice and implementing better steering instruments on resource allocation and quality are areas needing focus in the future. Conclusion. Many of the challenges for the Greenlandic health care system are being addressed with promising strategies, but only the future will show whether they are successful.

This paper examines the relationship between health care system characteristics, other social and economic characteristics of counties in a mid-western U.S. state and an individual's ability to meet health care needs over a 12-month period. We conclude that policy interventions are needed that look beyond health resource allocation to address problems in health care access that contribute to inequities in health.

Aims: The objective of the paper is to present for the first time in public national health-care workforce census data for the first two years of the economic recession and the adopted bailout mechanism (2010 and 2011) (a) to evaluate the adequacy of the governmental effort in terms of organization and management of the health-care workforce in PHC; and (b) to identify constraints and opportunities for the development of an integrated PHC ensuring access to health-care services for all. Methods: Data were drawn from the national project 'Health Monitoring Indicators System: Health Map' coordinated scientifically by the National School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology. They referred to the 202 PHCs and their regional surgeries (with 98% response rate). Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were used for the analysis. Findings: The findings pointed that PHC absorbs a very limited part of the national health system's workforce. Important inequalities in the numerical and geographical allocation of the PHC health workforce specialties across the country in favor of the medical profession and to the detriment of rural areas and the islands were identified, raising concerns about the policymakers' ability to meet the emerging needs of the population, as the retrospective study of the health-care workforce, since 2010, reveals that the numerical and per type allocations remained almost unchanged. These results were in line with previous studies showcasing the lack of holistic approach for PHC questioning the restrictive spending policy (ie, salary and benefit cuts for the health-care professionals, important discharges and nonrenewal of the personnel) adopted in the public health-care sector.\", \"Aim: The aim of this paper is to examine Canadian key informants' perceptions of intrapersonal (within an individual) and interpersonal (among individuals) factors that influence successful primary care and public health collaboration. Background: Primary health care systems can be strengthened by building stronger collaborations between primary care and public health. Although there is literature that explores interpersonal factors that can influence successful inter-organizational collaborations, a few of them have specifically explored primary care and public health collaboration. Furthermore, no papers were found that considered factors at the intrapersonal level. This paper aims to explore these gaps in a Canadian context. Methods: This interpretative descriptive study involved key informants (service providers, managers, directors, and policy makers) who participated in one h telephone interviews to explore their perceptions of influences on successful primary care and public health collaboration. Transcripts were analyzed using NVivo 9. Findings: A total of 74 participants [from the provinces of British Columbia (n = 20); Ontario (n = 19); Nova Scotia (n = 21), and representatives from other provinces or national organizations (n = 14)] participated. Five interpersonal factors were found that influenced public health and primary care collaborations including: (1) trusting and inclusive relationships; (2) shared values, beliefs and attitudes; (3) role clarity; (4) effective communication; and (5) decision processes. There were two influencing factors found at the intrapersonal level: (1) personal qualities, skills and knowledge; and (2) personal values, beliefs, and attitudes. A few differences were found across the three core provinces involved. There were several complex interactions identified among all inter and intra personal influencing factors: One key factor - effective communication - interacted with all of them. Results support and extend our understanding of what influences successful primary care and public health collaboration at these levels and are important considerations in building and sustaining primary care and public health collaborations.\", \"Background: Adequate care for individuals living with chronic illnesses calls for a healthcare system redesign, moving from acute, disease-centered to patient-centered models. The aim of this study was to identify Belgian stakeholders' perceptions on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the healthcare system for people with chronic diseases in Belgium. Methods: Four focus groups were held with stakeholders from the micro and meso level, in addition to two interviews with stakeholders who could not attend the focus group sessions. Data collection and the discussion were based on the Chronic Care model. Thematic analysis of the transcripts allowed for the identification of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the current health care system with focus on chronic care. Results: Informants stressed the overall good quality of the acute health care system and the level of reimbursement of care as an important strength of the current system. In contrast, the lack of integration of care was identified as one of the biggest weaknesses of today's health care system, along with the unclear definitions of the roles and functions of health professionals involved in care processes. Patient education to support self-management exists for patients with diabetes and/or terminal kidney failure but not for those living with other or multiple chronic conditions. The current overall fee-for-service system is a barrier to integrated care, as are the lack of incentives for integrated care. Attending multidisciplinary meetings, for example, is underfinanced to date. Finally, clinical information systems lack interoperability, which further impedes the information flow across settings and disciplines. Conclusion: Our study's methods allowed for the identification of problematic domains in the health system for people living with chronic conditions. These findings provided useful insights surrounding perceived priorities. This methodology may inspire other countries faced with the challenge of drafting reforms to tackle the issue of chronic care.\", \"Many rural veterans receive care in community settings but could benefit from VA services for certain needs, presenting an opportunity for coordination across systems. This article details the Collaborative Systems of Care (CSC) program, a novel, nurse-led care coordination program identifying and connecting veterans presenting for care in a Federally Qualified Health Center to VA behavioral health and other services based upon the veteran's preferences and eligibility. The CSC program systematically identifies veteran patients, screens for common behavioral health issues, explores VA eligibility for interested veterans, and facilitates coordination with VA to improve healthcare access. While the present program focuses on behavioral health, there is a unique emphasis on assisting veterans with the eligibility and enrollment process and coordinating additional care tailored to the patient. As VA expands its presence in community care, opportunities for VA-community care coordination will increase, making the development and implementation of such interventions important.\", \"Health literacy is fundamental if people are to successfully manage their own health. This requires a range of skills and knowledge about health and health care, including finding, understanding, interpreting and communicating health information, seeking of appropriate care and making critical health decisions. A primary health system that is appropriate and universally accessible requires an active agenda based on research of approaches to address low health literacy, while health care providers should be alert to the widespread problems of health literacy which span all age levels. 7-bis article reviews the progress made in Australia on health literacy in primary health care since health literacy was included in Australia's health goals and targets in the mid-1990s. A database search of published literature was conducted to identify existing examples of health literacy programs in Australia. Considerable work has been done on mental health literacy, and research into chronic disease self-management with CALD communities, which, includes health literacy, is under way. However, the lack of breadth in research has led to a knowledge base that is patchy. The few Australian studies located on health literacy research together with the data about general literacy in Australia suggests the need for much, more work to be done to increase our knowledge base about health literacy, in order to develop appropriate resources and tools to manage low health literacy in primary health settings.\", \"Medicare is central to accessing health care in Australia, yet many asylum seekers are ineligible for this scheme. In NSW, Medicare ineligible asylum seekers have some access to public health care under the Medicare Ineligible Asylum Seekers - Provision of Specified Public Health Services policy. This policy was updated in November 2020 to clarify services where a fee waiver applies for asylum seekers without Medicare. We examined the experiences of Medicare ineligible asylum seekers in accessing health care in New South Wales (NSW) in light of the revised policy. Employing qualitative methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with asylum seekers (n = 7) and service providers (n = 6) in South Western Sydney. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and the socio-ecological model was used to interpret the data. Participants identified that chronic and mental health conditions are the main health issues for asylum seekers. Factors across the four levels of the socio-ecological model were identified as influencing the health care of asylum seekers, including a lack of awareness about health care rights at the individual level, support from relatives and friends at the interpersonal level, providers' lack of awareness of fee waivers at the organizational level and limited access to primary health care at the policy level. The results imply that Medicare ineligible asylum seekers in NSW do not have optimal access to health care which may worsen existing health disparities. Educational initiatives that improve service providers' and asylum seekers' awareness of the revised policy are needed to improve asylum seeker health equity in NSW.\", 'Objective To disentangle the relationships among food insecurity, health care utilization, and health care expenditures. Data Sources/Study Setting We use national data on 13 465 adults (age >= 18) from the 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the first year of the food insecurity measures. Study Design We employ two-stage empirical models (probit for any health care use/expenditure, ordinary least squares, and generalized linear models for amount of utilization/expenditure), controlling for demographics, health insurance, poverty status, chronic conditions, and other predictors. Principal Findings Our results show that the likelihood of any health care expenditure (total, inpatient, emergency department, outpatient, and pharmaceutical) is higher for marginal, low, and very low food secure individuals. Relative to food secure households, very low food secure households are 5.1 percentage points (P < .001) more likely to have any health care expenditure, and have total health care expenditures that are 24.8 percent higher (P = .011). However, once we include chronic conditions in the models (ie, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, emphysema, high cholesterol, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and asthma), these underlying health conditions mitigate the differences in expenditures by food insecurity status (only the likelihood of any having any health care expenditure for very low food secure households remains statistically significant). Conclusions Policy makers and government agencies are focused on addressing deficiencies in social determinants of health and the resulting impacts on health status and health care utilization. Our results indicate that chronic conditions are strongly associated with food insecurity and higher health care spending. Efforts to alleviate food insecurity should consider the dual burden of chronic conditions. Finally, future research can address specific mechanisms underlying the relationships between food security, health, and health care.', 'BackgroundPrimary health care (PHC) is the ideal setting to provide integrated services centred on the person and to implement health promotion (HP) activities. ObjectiveTo identify proposals to approach HP in the context of primary care according to health-care users aged 45-75years, key community informants and primary care centre (PCC) workers. MethodsDescriptive-interpretive qualitative research with 276 participants from 14 PCC of seven Spanish regions. A theoretical sampling was used for selection. A total of 25 discussion groups, two triangular groups and 30 semi-structured interviews were carried out. A thematic interpretive contents analysis was carried out. ResultsParticipants consider that HP is not solely a matter for the health sector and they emphasize intersectoral collaboration. They believe that it is important to strengthen community initiatives and to create a healthy social environment that encourages greater responsibility and participation of health-care users in decisions regarding their own health and better management of public services and resources. HP, care in the community and demedicalization should be priorities for PHC. Participants propose organizational changes in the PCC to improve HP. PCC workers are aware that HP falls within the scope of their responsibilities and propose to increase their training, motivation, competences and knowledge of the social environment. Informants emphasize that HP should be person-centred approach and empathic communication. HP activities should be appealing, ludic and of proven effectiveness. ConclusionsAccording to a socio-ecological and intersectoral model, PHC services must get actively involved in HP together with community and through outreach interventions.', \"Background Ukraine is reforming its health care system to improve quality of health care. Insight into how primary health care managers perceive quality is important for the ongoing reform as well as for the improvement of medical services. Methods An online survey was conducted as part of the Ukrainian-Swiss project Medical Educational Development in April-May 2019 based on the contact list of USAID project Health Reform Support, and additionally on the database of the National Health Service of Ukraine and other channels. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis. Results In total, 302 health care managers took part in the study. The majority of primary health care managers perceive quality in health care as process quality. They associate quality mostly with compliance to standards. At the same time, primary health care managers prefer to assess outcome quality via a system of indicators and feedback. There appears to be a lack of consensus about health care quality. This may be due to a lack of awareness of the national strategy for better quality of health care service. Conclusions Our study provides new insights into primary care managers' perceptions of health care quality in Ukraine. The absence of a clear consensus about quality complicates the discussion about quality and how to measure quality in health care. This appears to be one of the obstacles to system-wide quality improvement.\", 'ObjectivesThis study explores the relationship between end-of-life care costs and place of death across different health and social care sectors.MethodsWe used a linked local government and health data of East London residents (n=4661) aged 50 or over, deceased between 2016 and 2020. Individuals who died in hospital were matched to those who died elsewhere according to a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. We reported mean healthcare costs and 95% CIs by care sectors over the 12-month period before death. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate if the role of place of death differs according to long-term conditions and age.ResultsWe found that mean difference in total cost between hospital and non-hospital decedents was & POUND;4565 (95% CI & POUND;3132 to & POUND;6046). Hospital decedents were associated with higher hospital cost (& POUND;5196, & POUND;4499 to & POUND;5905), higher mental healthcare cost (& POUND;283, & POUND;78 to & POUND;892) and lower social care cost (-& POUND;838, -& POUND;1,209 to -& POUND;472), compared with individuals who died elsewhere. Subgroup analysis shows that the association between place of death and healthcare costs differs by age and long-term conditions, including cancer, mental health and cardiovascular diseases.ConclusionThis study suggests that trajectories of end-of-life healthcare costs vary by place of death in a differential way across health and social care sectors. High hospital burden for cancer patients may be alleviated by strengthening healthcare provision in less cost-intensive settings, such as community and social care.', \"Objective. To examine the relationship between features of managed care organizations (MCOs) and health care use patterns by children. Data Sources. Telephone survey data from 2,223 parents of children with special health care needs, MCO-administrator interview data, and health care claims data. Study Design. Cross-sectional survey data from families about the number of consequences of their children's conditions and from MCO administrators about their plans' organizational features were used. Indices reflecting the MCO characteristics were developed using data reduction techniques. Hierarchical models were developed to examine the relationship between child sociodemographic and health characteristics and the MCO indices labeled: Pediatrician Focused (PF) Index, Specialist Focused (SF) Index, and Fee-for-Service (FFS) Index, and outpatient use rates and charges, inpatient admissions, emergency room (ER) visits, and specialty consultations. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. The telephone and MCO-administrator survey data were linked to the enrollment and claims files. Principal Findings. The child's age, gender, and condition consequences were consistent predictor variables related to health care use and charges. The PF Index was associated with decreased outpatient use rates and charges and decreased inpatient admissions. The SF Index was associated with increased ER visits and decreased specialty consultations, while the FFS Index was associated with increased outpatient use rates and charges. Conclusion. After controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics, the PF, SF, and FFS indices were significantly associated with children's health care use patterns.\", \"BackgroundEfforts to progress oral healthcare reform can be challenging with competing interests of governments and service providers to achieve the intended outcomes. The value-based health care approach has been adopted in many areas of healthcare but has had limited applications to oral healthcare systems. Dental Health Services Victoria, an Australian state government funded entity, commenced its journey to value-based health care in 2016, to shift away from traditional dental service models that reward activity and volume towards a stronger emphasis on value and outcomes. AimsTo maintain the value-based health care agenda focus, Dental Health Services Victoria developed three key principles, which can be adopted by other organisations engaged in reforming oral healthcare, to improve the oral health for the population it serves. Materials & MethodsIn 2018, Dental Health Services Victoria developed a value-based health care framework, which has informed strategic organisation priorities for action. In 2023, the following three key principles are identified as being essential to support the operationalisation and development of effective models of oral healthcare: Principle 1 - Care is co-designed with the person or population Principle 2 - Prevention and early intervention are prioritised. Principle 3 - Consistent measurement of health outcomes and costs are embedded. DiscussionThe exploration of the three key principles is an important communication tool to translate value-based health care into practice with key stakeholders. Further work is required to socialise them to within dental teams. ConclusionOrganisations looking to commence the value-based health care agenda can apply Dental Health Services Victoria's three key principles as a first step.\", 'Background: The objective of the Balearic Islands Palliative Care (PC) Program is to improve the quality of PC through a shared model consisting of primary health care professionals, home-based PC teams, and PC units in hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patients with advanced cancer and other terminal diseases benefit from early identification and proactive PC. We will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention in which a PC leader is established in the primary health care center, and assess the effect of this intervention on the early identification of patients in need of PC, the efficient use of health care services, and direct health care costs. Methods: Design: A two-arm cluster randomized clinical trial of 30 Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) in Mallorca (Spain), in which each center was randomized to an intervention arm or a usual care arm. We expect that the number of patients identified as suitable for PC (including non-oncological PC) is at least 5% greater in the intervention arm. Sample size: A total of 4640 deceased patients. Outcomes will be assessed by a blinded external review of the electronic records. Interventions: General practitioners (GPs) and nurse leaders in PC for each PHCC will be appointed. These leaders will help promote PC training of colleagues, improve symptom management and psychological support of patients, and evaluate the complexity of individual cases so that these cases receive assistance from PC home-based teams. Measurements: Early identification (>90 days before death), evaluation of case complexity, level of case complexity (with referral to a home-based PC team), use and cost of hospital and primary care services, and quality of life during the last month of life (>= 2 emergency room visits, >= 2 hospital admissions, >= 14 days of hospitalization). Discusion: PC leaders in primary care teams will improve the early identification of patients eligible for PC. This initiative could improve the quality of end-of-life care and utilization of hospital resources.', 'Objective: To evaluate an innovative rural service offering comprehensive primary health care for mental health service clients. Design: A formative evaluation using mixed methods. Setting: A rural NSW community. Participants: Fifteen health care providers and 120 adult clients. Intervention: A monthly clinic held in a general practice to provide primary health care for clients of the community mental health team. Main outcome measures: Client utilisation and clinic activity data. Provider views of service effectiveness, possible improvements and sustainability. Results: The GP Clinic has operated successfully for 2.5 years without access block. Some 52% of clients had no physical illness and 82% were referred to other health and community services. In total, 40% continued to attend the clinic while 32% went on to consult a GP independently. Client access to care improved as did collaboration between the community mental health team and primary care providers. Conclusion: The GP Clinic is a straightforward and flexible service model that could be used more widely.', \"BackgroundPeople with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Primary prevention and health maintenance are therefore imperative. Evidence has shown that prediabetes can be prevented or delayed with behavioural change, mainly in eating habits and physical activity. Interventions that use a person-centered approach can lead to improvements in self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research that engages healthcare professionals and people with prediabetes in constructing and implementing preventive programs. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe how healthcare professionals perceive prediabetes, the current challenges in its detection and treatment, and what is needed to improve quality of care.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted in Region Stockholm. A total of 26 primary health care professionals participated in individual interviews: 15 diabetes nurses and/or district nurses, five general practitioners, five dietitians, and one physiotherapist. Interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis.ResultsThe analysis revealed two main themes that emphasize the need to make prediabetes more visible in primary health care. Despite the healthcare professionals' engagement and their motivation to improve prediabetes care, ad hoc practices and the absence of clear screening guidelines and referral pathways made it harder to focus on primary prevention. Supporting professionals in implementing structured care for people with prediabetes might encourage more efficient interprofessional collaboration and contribute to better strategies for promoting behavioural change.ConclusionsEstablishing prediabetes care guidelines, supporting health care professionals ' knowledge and skills in prediabetes care, and implementing interprofessional referral pathways are some steps to enhance prediabetes detection and care precedence in primary health care. These steps could lead to more preventive care and ensure patient safety and health care equity.\", \"Introduction: Aging is associated with multiple chronic conditions. In older age, health needs and demand for health services utilization increase. There are limited data in Nepal on the health care utilization as well as health care costs among the elderly population. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the factors hindering access to health care among Nepalese older adults. Our study aims to explore the health care utilization and expenditure among Nepali older adults. Method: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 401 older adults residing in Pokhara Lekhnath metropolitan of Nepal. The survey tool was adapted from the Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (SAGE)'s questions on Health Care Utilization. The predictors of health care utilization were assessed in binary logistic regression models. Results: Study participants, mean (+/- SD) age 70.2 (+/- 8.0) years, had various preexisting conditions such as hypertension (37.7 %), gastritis (28.4 %), asthma (25.4 %), and arthritis (23.4%) reported in the past 12 months but only 70% visited a health facility. A notable proportion (30%) of participants didn't utilize health services despite having a health problem. The utilization of out-patient and in-patient health services were 87.5 and 14.6% respectively. The use of private health facilities (56.4%) was high compared to the use of government health facilities (35.7%). Privileged ethnicity, living with a partner, higher annual income, knowledge of social insurance, and multi-morbidity were associated with higher odds of utilizing health services. Participants of privileged ethnicity, with higher household income, attending private health facility, and having multi-morbidities had significantly higher out of pocket health expenditures. Conclusions: A notable proportion of elderly participants did not utilize health services despite having a health problem. The public health system must develop effective strategies to attract this segment of the society. High dependency on private health facilities, as noted in the study, will only lead toward higher out of pocket health expenditures. The health benefits of regular health screenings must be disseminated among the elderly population. Developing quality and affordable health care services for older adults to ensure equity in accessibility will be a major task for the public health system in Nepal.\", \"AimThis paper describes the policy context and approaches taken to improve access to primary health care in Australia by supporting nurses to deliver improved integrated care meeting community needs. ContextIn Primary Health Care (PHC), the nursing workforce are predominantly employed in the general practice sector. Despite evidence that nurse-led models of care can bridge traditional treatment silos in the provision of specialised and coordinated care, PHC nurses' scope of practice varies dramatically. Nurse-led models of care are imperative for rural and remote populations that experience workforce shortages and barriers to accessing health care. Existing barriers include policy constraints, limited organisational structures, education and financing models. ApproachThe Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association (APNA) received funding to implement nurse-led clinics as demonstration projects. The clinics enable PHC nurses to work to their full scope of practice, improve continuity of care and increase access to health care in under serviced locations. We reviewed a range of peer-reviewed literature, policy documents, grey literature and APNA provided sources, particularly those relevant to rural and remote populations. We argue more focus is needed on how to address variations in the scope of practice of the rural and remote PHC nursing workforce. ConclusionDespite growing evidence for the effectiveness of nurse-led models of care, significant policy and financial barriers continue to inhibit PHC nurses working to their full scope of practice. If their potential to transform health care and increase access to health services is to be realised these barriers must be addressed.\", 'This paper investigates whether managed care ameliorates or aggravates ethnic and racial health care disparities in Medicare. First, we analyze the choice of type of insurance made by Medicare enrollees to see if minorities are more likely to choose the managed care alternative. Second, we study the differential effect of managed care on disparities using several measures of access, use and cost of services. Both analyses are conducted on two independent data sets, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. We conclude that relative to Whites, minorities are at least as well off-in terms of benefits and costs-in Medicare managed care as in Medicare traditional indemnity plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Methods. A 3-year experimental study was conducted in 5 California counties and 111 licensed child care centers (73 intervention, 38 comparison) participated at the baseline and post-intervention times. Trained research assistants conducted objective observations with a Policies Checklist and Health and Safety Checklist, which were composed of key national health and safety standards. Results. At baseline, both groups were not significantly different on the Policies Checklist and the Health and Safety Checklist. At the post intervention time, intervention centers had significantly more and higher-quality written health and safety policies on 9 of the 10 policies rated (medication administration. care of mildly ill children, exclusion of ill children, cleaning and sanitizing, handwashing, daily health checks, inclusion of children with special needs, emergency preparedness, staff health) than comparison centers. At the post-intervention time, intervention centers improved their health and safety practices in the areas of emergency preparedness and handwashing, controlling for consultation model, time in study, and director turnover. Both groups improved their indoor and outdoor facilities and overall Health and Safety Checklist means. Conclusions. Child care health consultation programs can improve the written health and safety policies and may improve practices in child care centers.\", 'Background: The medical home (MH) model has prompted increasing attention given its potential to improve quality of care while reducing health expenditures. Objectives: We compare overall and specific health care expenditures in Belgium, from the third-party payer perspective (compulsory social insurance), between patients treated at individual practices (IP) and at MHs. We compare the sociodemographic profile of MH and IP users. Research Design: This is a retrospective study using public insurance claims data. Generalized linear models estimate the impact on health expenditures of being treated at a MH versus IP, controlling for individual, and area-based sociodemographic characteristics. The choice of primary care setting is modeled using logistic regressions. Subjects: A random sample of 43,678 persons followed during the year 2004. Measures: Third-party payer expenditures for primary care, secondary care consultations, pharmaceuticals, laboratory tests, acute and long-term inpatient care. Results: Overall third-party payer expenditures do not differ significantly between MH and IP users ((sic)+27). Third-party payer primary care expenditures are higher for MH than for IP users ((sic)+129), but this difference is offset by lower expenditures for secondary care consultations ((sic)-11), drugs ((sic)-40), laboratory tests ((sic)-5) and acute and long-term inpatient care ((sic)-53). MHs attract younger and more underprivileged populations. Conclusions: MHs induce a shift in expenditures from secondary care, drugs, and laboratory tests to primary care, while treating a less economically favored population. Combined with positive results regarding quality, MH structures are a promising way to tackle the challenges of primary care.', \"Background To improve mental health care access, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) implemented Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) in clinics nationally. Primary care clinical leader satisfaction can inform model implementation and may be facilitated by collaborative care managers and technology supporting cross-specialty collaboration. Objective (1) To determine primary care clinical leaders' overall satisfaction with care from embedded mental health providers for a range of conditions and (2) to examine the association between overall satisfaction and two program features (care managers, technology). Design Cross-sectional organizational survey in one VA region (Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico), 2018. Participants Sixty-nine physicians or other designated clinical leaders in each VA primary care clinic (94% response rate). Main Measures We assessed primary care clinical leader satisfaction with embedded mental health care on four groups of conditions: target, non-target mental health, behavioral health, suicide risk management. They additionally responded about the availability of mental health care managers and the sufficiency of information technology (telemental health, e-consult, instant messaging). We examined relationships between satisfaction and the two program features using chi(2)tests and multivariable regressions. Key Results Most primary care clinical leaders were very satisfied with care for targeted anxiety (71%) and depression (69%), but not for other common conditions (37% alcohol misuse, 19% pain). Care manager availability was significantly associated with very satisfied responses for depression (p = .02) and anxiety care by embedded mental health providers (p = .02). Highly rated sufficiency of communication technology (only 19%) was associated with very satisfied responses to suicide risk management (p = .002). Conclusions Care from embedded mental health providers for depression and anxiety was highly satisfactory, which may guide improvement among less satisfactory conditions (alcohol misuse, pain). Observed associations between overall satisfaction and collaborative care features may inform clinics on how to optimize staffing and technology based on priority conditions.\", 'Background: Immigrants make up one fifth of the Canadian population and this number continues to grow. Adequate access to primary health care is important for this population but it is not clear if this is being achieved. This study explored patient reported access to primary health care of a population of immigrants in Ontario, Canada who were users of the primary care system and compared this with Canadian-born individuals; and by model of primary care practice. Methods: This study uses data from the Comparison of Models of Primary Care Study (COMP-PC), a mixed-methods, practice-based, cross-sectional study that collected information from patients and providers in 137 primary care practices across Ontario, Canada in 2005-2006. The practices were randomly sampled to ensure an equal number of practices in each of the four dominant primary care models at that time: Fee-For-Service, Community Health Centres, and the two main capitation models (Health Service Organization and Family Health Networks). Adult patients of participating practices were identified when they presented for an appointment and completed a survey in the waiting room. Three measures of access were used, all derived from the patient survey: First Contact Access, First Contact Utilization (both based on the Primary Care Assessment Tool) and number of self-reported visits to the practice in the past year. Results: Of the 5,269 patients who reported country of birth 1,099 (20.8%) were born outside of Canada. In adjusted analysis, recent immigrants (arrival in Canada within the past five years) and immigrants in Canada for more than 20 years were less likely to report good health compared to Canadian-born (Odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.36,0.92 and 0.81, 95% CI 0.67,0.99). Overall, immigrants reported equal access to primary care services compared with Canadian-born. Within immigrant groups recently arrived immigrants had similar access scores to Canadian-born but reported 5.3 more primary care visits after adjusting for health status. Looking across models, recent immigrants in Fee-For-Service practices reported poorer access and fewer primary care visits compared to Canadian-born. Conclusions: Overall, immigrants who were users of the primary care system reported a similar level of access as Canadian-born individuals. While recent immigrants are in poorer health compared with Canadian-born they report adequate access to primary care. The differences in access for recently arrived immigrants, across primary care models suggests that organizational features of primary care may lead to inequity in access.', 'BackgroundHealthcare coordination and continuity of care conceptualize all care providers and organizations involved in health care to ensure the right care at the right time. However, systematic evidence synthesis is lacking in the care coordination of health services. This scoping review synthesizes evidence on different levels of care coordination of primary health care (PHC) and primary care.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of published evidence on healthcare coordination. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched until 30 November 2022 for studies that describe care coordination/continuity of care in PHC and primary care. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to select studies. We analysed data using a thematic analysis approach and explained themes adopting a multilevel (individual, organizational, and system) analytical framework.ResultsA total of 56 studies were included in the review. Most studies were from upper-middle-income or high-income countries, primarily focusing on continuity/care coordination in primary care. Ten themes were identified in care coordination in PHC/primary care. Four themes under care coordination at the individual level were the continuity of services, linkage at different stages of health conditions (from health promotion to rehabilitation), health care from a life-course (conception to elderly), and care coordination of health services at places (family to hospitals). Five themes under organizational level care coordination included interprofessional, multidisciplinary services, community collaboration, integrated care, and information in care coordination. Finally, a theme under system-level care coordination was related to service management involving multisectoral coordination within and beyond health systems.ConclusionsContinuity and coordination of care involve healthcare provisions from family to health facility throughout the life-course to provide a range of services. Several issues could influence multilevel care coordination, including at the individual (services or users), organizational (providers), and system (departments and sectors) levels. Health systems should focus on care coordination, ensuring types of care per the healthcare needs at different stages of health conditions by a multidisciplinary team. Coordinating multiple technical and supporting stakeholders and sectors within and beyond health sector is also vital for the continuity of care especially in resource-limited health systems and settings.', \"Background: In 2010, a national integrated health care standard for (childhood) obesity was published and disseminated in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the needs of health care providers and the barriers they face in terms of implementing this integrated health care standard. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was applied using focus groups, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and an e-mail-based internet survey. The study's participants included: general practitioners (GPs) (focus groups); health care providers in different professions (face-to-face interviews) and health care providers, including GPs; youth health care workers; pediatricians; dieticians; psychologists and physiotherapists (survey). First, the transcripts from the focus groups were analyzed thematically. The themes identified in this process were then used to analyze the interviews. The results of the analysis of the qualitative data were used to construct the statements used in the e-mail-based internet survey. Responses to items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale and were categorized into three outcomes: 'agree' or 'important' (response categories 1 and 2), 'disagree' or 'not important'. Results: Twenty-seven of the GPs that were invited (51 %) participated in four focus groups. Seven of the nine health care professionals that were invited (78 %) participated in the interviews and 222 questionnaires (17 %) were returned and included in the analysis. The following key barriers were identified with regard to the implementation of the integrated health care standard: reluctance to raise the subject; perceived lack of motivation and knowledge on the part of the parents; previous negative experiences with lifestyle programs; financial constraints and the lack of a structured multidisciplinary approach. The main needs identified were: increased knowledge and awareness on the part of both health care providers and parents/children; a social map of effective intervention; structural funding; task rearrangements; a central care coordinator and structural information feedback from the health care providers involved. Conclusions: The integrated health care standard stipulate that the care of overweight or obese children be provided using an integrated approach. The barriers and needs identified in this study can be used to define strategies to improve the implementation of the integrated health care standard pertaining to overweight and obese children in the Netherlands.\", 'Background Due to gender inequities that exist for women of childbearing age, there exists a need to deliver care tailored to their needs and preferences. Patient-centred care (PCC) can be used to meet these needs. This review aims to compare patient care delivery between PCC and obstetrical care. This can help us address how PCC should be delivered to women before, during and after pregnancy versus how it is delivered to patients regardless of sex. Methods A review of literature was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for English PCC and high-quality perinatal reviews published between 2010 and 2021. The data were analysed using a modified Walker and Avant framework. Results A total of 2138 unique studies were identified, with 11 PCC and 9 high-quality obstetrical care studies included. Common defining features between PCC and obstetrical care include respect and dignity, informed decision-making, therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. PCC-specific features were holistic care, empowerment, individualized care, coordinated care and empathy. Unique high-quality obstetrical care themes included continuity of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education and status, physical environment and equitable maternal care. Conclusions There are shared defining attributes between PCC and obstetrical care, including respect and dignity, informed decision-making, the therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. However, there remain unique defining attributes for high-quality obstetrical care and PCC. This highlights the need for a unique approach to obstetrical care. More research on care for different physiological conditions in women is needed to address patient care that addresses different parts of the lifespan and develop frameworks that can influence health policy, patient care and health system evaluation. Patient or Public Contribution This study was one part of a larger, multicomponent study of how to implement PCC for women across the lifespan. While we did not specifically consult or involve women in this dual concept analysis, our larger study (content analysis of clinical guidelines and government policies, qualitative interviews with women and clinicians, Delphi study to prioritize consensus recommendations for achieving PCC for women) was guided by the experiences and input of a 50+ women advisory panel.', \"Policy Points A consensus regarding the need to orient health systems to address inequities is emerging, with much of this discussion targeting population health interventions and indicators. We know less about applying these approaches to primary health care. This study empirically demonstrates that providing more equity-oriented health care (EOHC) in primary health care, including trauma- and violence-informed, culturally safe, and contextually tailored care, predicts improved health outcomes across time for people living in marginalizing conditions. This is achieved by enhancing patients' comfort and confidence in their care and their own confidence in preventing and managing health problems. This promising new evidence suggests that equity-oriented interventions at the point of care can begin to shift inequities in health outcomes for those with the greatest need. Context Significant attention has been directed toward addressing health inequities at the population health and systems levels, yet little progress has been made in identifying approaches to reduce health inequities through clinical care, particularly in a primary health care context. Although the provision of equity-oriented health care (EOHC) is widely assumed to lead to improvements in patients' health outcomes, little empirical evidence supports this claim. To remedy this, we tested whether more EOHC predicts more positive patient health outcomes and identified selected mediators of this relationship. Methods Our analysis uses longitudinal data from 395 patients recruited from 4 primary health care clinics serving people living in marginalizing conditions. The participants completed 4 structured interviews composed of self-report measures and survey questions over a 2-year period. Using path analysis techniques, we tested a hypothesized model of the process through which patients' perceptions of EOHC led to improvements in self-reported health outcomes (quality of life, chronic pain disability, and posttraumatic stress [PTSD] and depressive symptoms), including particular covariates of health outcomes (age, gender, financial strain, experiences of discrimination). Findings Over a 24-month period, higher levels of EOHC predicted greater patient comfort and confidence in the health care patients received, leading to increased confidence to prevent and manage their health problems, which, in turn, improved health outcomes (depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, and quality of life). In addition, financial strain and experiences of discrimination had significant negative effects on all health outcomes. Conclusions This study is among the first to demonstrate empirically that providing more EOHC predicts better patient health outcomes over time. At a policy level, this research supports investments in equity-focused organizational and provider-level processes in primary health care as a means of improving patients' health, particularly for those living in marginalizing conditions. Whether these results are robust in different patient groups and across a broader range of health care contexts requires further study.\", 'Introduction: The study objectives are to describe the national health and safety standards in family child care homes (FCCHs) and child care centers and compare them by child care type. Method: Child care health consultants and research assistants completed the standardized Health and Safety Checklist, which comprised key national health and safety standards, in a convenience sample of 21 FCCHs and 31 child care centers enrolled in two larger studies conducted in CA. Results: The checklist was completed in 1 or 2 hours in FCCHs and centers, respectively. The internal consistency of the overall checklist subscales was moderate to strong. Eight of 10 checklist subscales were not significantly different in FCCHs and centers, but outdoor facilities (p < .05) and supervision, interaction, and physical activity (p < .05) were different. Discussion: The Health and Safety Checklist is valid in FCCHs and centers and identifies targeted interventions for nurses to improve child care quality.', 'Background: Use of telemental health has increased among rural Medicare beneficiaries, particularly among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Little is known about what leads to the initiation of telemental health. Objective: To categorize the different patterns of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health services among individuals with SMI. Methods: A cohort of rural beneficiaries with SMI (defined as schizophrenia/related psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder) with an index telemental health visit in 2010-2017 was built using claims for a 20% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The authors used latent class analysis to identify classes of mental health care use in the 6 months before the index telemental health visits. Across the classes, the authors also described characteristics of index and subsequent mental health visits. Results: The cohort included 4930 rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Three classes of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health were identified. The largest class (n=3066) had minimal use of primary care provider mental health care and the second largest class (n=1537) had minimal specialty mental health care. The smallest class (n=327) was characterized by recent hospitalization or emergency department care. In the overall cohort, index visits were frequently established visits and were often with specialty prescribers. Conclusions: Our findings highlight 3 distinct patterns of care before telemental health initiation, providing insight into the role that telemedicine may play in mental health care for rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Overall, telemental health was most often used to maintain care with existing providers.', \"Purpose: Youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) increasingly live into adulthood, and approximately 500,000 U.S. youth transition from pediatric to adult health care systems annually. Through a systematic literature review, we sought to (1) determine adult outcomes for YSHCN who have no special transition interventions and (2) identify evidence for strategies that lead to better outcomes, in particular, access to adult health care. Methods: We searched the medical, nursing, psychology, and social science literature and reviewed selected articles' reference lists. Transition experts also recommended relevant articles. Search criteria included health conditions, transition-related activities, and health care and related outcomes. We selected English-language articles published from 1986 to 2010, with an abstract, description of transition-related interventions (objective 2), and posttransition outcomes. Investigators abstracted study design, population, sample size, description of intervention, data collection methods, and findings. Results: The search yielded 3,370 articles, of which 15 met study criteria. Although many YSHCN appear to make the transition to adult health providers successfully, some experience serious gaps in outcomes; those with more complex conditions or with conditions affecting the nervous system appear to have less good transitions. Some evidence supports introducing YSHCN to adult providers before leaving the pediatric system; one study supports using care coordinators to improve outcomes. Conclusions: Evidence regarding programs to facilitate transition for YSHCN is inconclusive. Weak evidence suggests that meeting adult providers before transfer may facilitate posttransition access to care. We recommend additional studies with strong research designs to guide best practice in preparing YSHCN for adulthood. (c) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Despite these efforts, many Americans do not have access to basic medical care. This study was designed to identify barriers faced by low-income parents when accessing health care for their children and how insurance status affects their reporting of these barriers. METHODS A mixed methods analysis was undertaken using 722 responses to an open-ended question on a health care access survey instrument that asked low-income Oregon families, Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Themes were identified using immersion/crystallization techniques. Pertinent demographic attributes were used to conduct matrix coded queries. RESULTS Families reported 3 major barriers: lack of insurance coverage, poor access to services, and unafforclable costs. Disproportionate reporting of these themes was most notable based on insurance status. A higher percentage of uninsured parents (87%) reported experiencing difficulties obtaining insurance coverage compared with 40% of those with insurance. Few of the uninsured expreswsed concerns about access to services or health access to services or health care costs (19%). Access concerns were the most common among publicly insured families, and costs were more often mentioned by families with private insurance. Families made a clear distinction between insurance and access, and having one or both elements did not assure Care. Our analyses-income families. uncovered a 3-part typology of barriers to health care for low-income families. CONCLUSIONS Barriers to health care can be insurmountable for low-income families, even those with insurance coverage. Patients who do not seek care in a family medicine clinic are not necessarily getting their care elsewhere.', 'Purpose: To examine health care spending patterns for U.S. adolescents aged 10 to 18 years using nationally representative household survey data. Methods: We analyzed data from the 1997 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey on total expenditures and out-of-pocket expenditures for health care based on a sample of 4882 adolescents. Results: Compared with that for adults, health care expenditures for adolescents were low, averaging $799 per adolescent in 1997. Disabled and functionally impaired adolescents had disproportionately high expenditures ($1960 per capita). Blacks and adolescents living in poor families had disproportionately low expenditures ($358 and $609 per capita, respectively). Professional services provided by physicians and dentists accounted for more than one-half of all health care spending for adolescents. Only 2% of adolescents were hospitalized in 1997, but they accounted for about one-fifth of all health care expenditures. The share of health expenditures paid out of pocket varied by type of service, ranging from 3% for inpatient hospital care to 51% for dental care. When covered, insurance provided substantial financial protection for families of adolescents: those with public coverage paid 8%, those with private coverage paid 32%, and those without coverage paid 61% of their health care bills out of pocket. The share of health care bills paid out of pocket would be much lower if dental care was excluded. Conclusions: On the basis of our findings that health care expenditures for adolescents are low and that insurance coverage provides critically needed financial protection, we conclude that further expansions of public and private health insurance coverage for this population would provide significant benefits at modest additional cost. Additional efforts to improve coverage of services that are not now well-covered, such as dental care, would also be valuable. (C) Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2003.', 'Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the extent of ultrasound availability in Norwegian casualty clinics and estimate the prevalence of its use. Design: A retrospective study based on a national casualty clinic registry and data from reimbursement claims. Setting: Out-of-hours primary health care in Norway. Subjects: All Norwegian casualty clinics in 2016 and reimbursement claims from 2008 to 2015. Main outcome measures: Percent of casualty clinics with ultrasound, types of ultrasound devices and probes, reasons for/against ultrasound access, characteristics of clinics with/without ultrasound, frequency of five ultrasound indications and characteristics of the physicians using/not using ultrasound. Results: Out of 182 casualty clinics, 41 (23%) reported access to ultrasound. Mobile (49%) and stationary (44%) devices were most frequent. Physician request was the most common cited reason for ultrasound access (66%). Neither population served by the casualty clinic nor distance to hospital showed any clear association with ultrasound access. All of the five ultrasound reimbursement codes showed a substantial increase from 2008 to 2015 with 14.1 ultrasound examinations being performed per 10,000 consultations in 2015. Only 6.5% of physicians performed ultrasound in 2015 and males were significantly more likely to use ultrasound than females (OR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.38-2.47, p<.001), even when adjusted for age, speciality status and geography. Conclusions: Although the use of ultrasound is increasing in out-of-hours Norwegian primary health care, most casualty clinics do not have access and only a minority of physicians use ultrasound.', \"The use of information and communication technologies in health and health care could improve healthcare quality in many ways. Today's evidence base demonstrates the (cost-)effectiveness of online education, self-management support and tele-monitoring in several domains of health and care. While new results gradually provide more evidence for eHealth's impact on quality issues, now is the time to come to grips with implementation issues. Documented drawbacks such as low acceptance, low adoption or low adherence need our attention today to make the most of eHealth' potential. Improvement science is beginning to deliver the tools to address these persistent behavioural and cultural issues. The ceHRes Roadmap, for instance, is a plural and pragmatic approach that includes users' needs. It is now imperative to improve our implementation strategies in order to scale up eHealth technologies. This will accelerate the much needed transformation of our healthcare systems and sustain access, affordability and quality for all in the near future.\", \"Work disability creates significant expenses for nations and causes human suffering by limiting patients' lives. International studies show that to enhance recognition of and support for work disability, cooperation, mutual trust, and information exchange between public primary health care and occupational health care must be strengthened. However, little is known of how health care professionals experience this cooperation. The aim of this study was to understand how professionals experience the cooperation between public primary health care and occupational health services regarding patients' work ability. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 health care professionals working in five small cities (<10,000 inhabitants) in Finland. Interviews were audio and video recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Three key themes were identified from the interviews: attitudes toward the other health care sector, the exchange of information, and resources for cooperation. Professionals seem to have poor knowledge about the services available and how care is given in the other sector, appearing to lead to weak mutual trust. The public primary health care professionals especially emphasized the benefits of cooperation, but several issues were mentioned as barriers to cooperation. These results can be used when planning effective patient paths and service provisioning models.\", \"During the last decade there has been considerable international mobilisation around shrinking the role of States in health care. The World Bank reports that, in many low and middle-income countries, private sources of finance comprise the largest share of total national health expenditures. Private sector health care is ubiquitous, reaches throughout the population, preferred by the people and is significant from both economic as well as health perspective. Resources are limited, governments are weak, and a new approach is needed. This paper provides a broad overview and raises key issues with regard to private health care. The focus is on provision of health care by private medical providers. On the background of the world's common health problems and interventions available to tackle them, the place of private health care in the overall context is first discussed. The concept of privatisation within the various forms of health care systems is then explained. The paper then describes the genesis and key elements of rapidly enhancing role of the private sector in health care and points to the paucity of literature from low and middle-income countries. Common concerns about private health care are outlined. Two illustrative examples - tuberculosis, the top infectious killer among the poor and coronary heart disease, the top noninfectious killer among the I ich - are presented to understand the current and possible role of private sector in provision of health care. Highlighting the need to distinguish between health care as a public good or a market commodity, the paper leaves it to the reader to draw conclusions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Primary care physicians (PCP) are filling expanded roles within oral health care to secure strong overall health for their patients. Methods: This comparative case study examines the roles of PCPs at 5 federally qualified health centers that have integrated oral health care and primary care. Administrative data were obtained directly from the Health Resources and Services Administration. Key informant interviews were performed with administrators and clinical care team members at each of the health centers. Data were reviewed by 2 experts in oral health to identify emerging roles for physicians. Results: PPCPs' roles in health centers' integration models vary, but 3 distinct roles emerged: (1) the physician as a champion, (2) the physician as a collaborator, and (3) the physician as a member of an interprofessional team. In addition, providing physicians with the necessary training to identify oral health issues was critical to preparing physicians to take on expanded roles in integrated health care delivery models. Conclusions: Regardless of the roles that they play, family physicians can contribute a great deal to the success of integration models.\", 'Aim: The major objectives of this study were to evaluate the existing pediatrics health care service provisions and utilizations of the public polyclinics in Barbados. Furthermore, the aim was to assess if the existing manpower resources were adequate. Background: Barbados has a mixed health care system consisting of both a socialized and a private health care system. The Ministry of Health commissioned a needs assessment survey of the pediatrics primary health care at the public polyclinics. Methods: Primary data were collected through interviews with the public primary health care providers. Secondary data were collected from the Barbados Census Data and Ministry of Health statistics. Data were analyzed to assess the pediatrics primary health care service utilization and adequacy of existing resources at the polyclinics. Findings: In 2012, there were 62 934 visits from children < 16 years of age to the public polyclinics in Barbados and this accounted for 39.1% of all visits (both adults and children) to the polyclinics. An overall 16.7% of the visits were from children less than five years old to the Well Child Clinic for immunization and for growth and development monitoring; 32% of all physician consultations at the polyclinics were for children < 16 years. Utilization of health services by children at the polyclinics was 5245 visits/month. Given an expected monthly demand for 10 822 visits from children, the polyclinics serve 48.5% of the primary health care demand for children in Barbados. Conclusions: The public polyclinics play a pivotal role in the pluralistic primary health care system in Barbados. They fulfill nearly half of all the primary care demand and more importantly provides for almost the entire immunization demand, and thereby ensuring high coverage. The existing resources, if used optimally, would reduce the long consultation time observed in this setting, and thereby increase the capacity considerably.', \"A visit to the dental clinic may be challenging for a child with Down syndrome due to medical and oral health problems as well as communication problems. The aim of the present study was to explore how parents of children with Down syndrome describe their child's needs in the dental health care setting. In a survey concerning parental experiences with dental health care in Sweden, free comments were analysed with content analysis and resulted in five categories: Need for continuity of care in dental health care; Need for dental health care professionals to have knowledge and expertise in caring for children with Down syndrome and other disabilities; Need for dental health care professionals to use a caring approach with children with Down syndrome; Need for the child with Down syndrome to be prepared to participate in their dental health care visit and Need for the child with Down syndrome to be given the same rights as typically developing children. To support children with Down syndrome in an optimal way, dental health care needs to be tailored to meet the child's unique needs. In addition, dental health care professionals need knowledge of and expertise in the care of children with Down syndrome.\", \"Objective To examine health status and health care experiences of homeless patients in health centers and to compare them with their nonhomeless counterparts. Data Sources/Study Setting Nationally representative data from the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey. Study Design Cross-sectional analyses were limited to adults (n=2,683). We compared sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, access to health care, and utilization of services among homeless and nonhomeless patients. We also examined the independent effect of homelessness on health care access and utilization, as well as factors that influenced homeless patients' health care experiences. Data Collection Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted with health center patients. Principal Findings Homeless patients had worse health statuslifetime burden of chronic conditions, mental health problems, and substance use problemscompared with housed respondents. In adjusted analyses, homeless patients had twice the odds as housed patients of having unmet medical care needs in the past year (OR=1.98, 95 percent CI: 1.243.16) and twice the odds of having an ED visit in the past year (OR=2.00, 95 percent CI: 1.372.92). Conclusions There is an ongoing need to focus on the health issues that disproportionately affect homeless populations. Among health center patients, homelessness is an independent risk factor for unmet medical needs and ED use.\", \"Background: Easy access to palliative care is one of the basic needs of cancer patients, and this can be achieved by providing such services at the community level. One approach to provide community-based palliative care is to integrate it with primary health care (PHC). Considering the antiquity and extension of the PHC system in Iran and the importance of being aware of stakeholders' views in order to integrate a palliative care provision model into a country's health care system, we aimed to explain health care providers' perception of the integration of palliative care with PHC. Methods: The present qualitative research was conducted using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from October 2016 to July 2020. The participants of the study included the stakeholders involved in providing palliative care to cancer patients, as well as PHC system experts. The participants were selected purposefully using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected through holding 21 semi-structured interviews and one focused group session and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results: Qualitative data analysis revealed three main categories and ten subcategories. The main categories included the health system's structure as an opportunity (with the subcategories of employing the network system for providing health services, establishment of a referral system, and establishment of the family physician program and manpower diversity), requirements (with the subcategories of the position of home care centers and their relationship with PHC, opioid use management, equipment management, financial support, and legal issues), and outcomes (with the subcategories of facilitated access to services and good death). Conclusion: Iran's health system possesses adequate infrastructure for providing palliative care to cancer patients within the context of PHC. Beside available opportunities, there are also problems that need to be resolved so that families can meet their patients' care needs and provide them with an easy death by having access to home-based palliative care.\", 'Aim: Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) are primary care clinics certified through Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to the medically underserved in rural areas of the United States. The purpose of this paper is to describe how the characteristics of RHCs have either changed or remained stable over a 10-year period in the past: from the late 1990s to 2007. In addition, it is also to describe some of the outstanding needs of RHCs as they navigate the transitions of U.S. health care reform. Methods: Using a panel of RHCs continuously in existence from 2006 through 2007, we calculated and compared statistics with corresponding statistics from the literature. We described the geographic distribution of RHCs, demographics of their counties of location, and characteristics of RHC structure and staffing. We also explored the implications of the recently enacted health reform law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) for RHCs, and the improvements that RHCs need as it is implemented. Findings: By the end of the study period, the highest percentages of RHCs were in the South and Midwest, the percentage of RHCs in the West had grown, and that in the South had declined. RHCs served counties with increasing proportions of individuals below poverty and Hispanics/Latinos. The percentage of independent clinics had grown, as had the percentage of for-profit clinics. Finally, the percentage of nurse practitioner full-time equivalents had grown as a proportion of the total for three providers. Conclusions: In investigating the performance of RHCs, many managerial and operational factors are not well understood. It is imperative that RHCs gather the information that could help them maximize the elements of their performance that would keep them financially stable. In addition, a broader awareness of the unique challenges that RHCs face in this era of health care reform is needed.', 'Introduction: Many families enroll their infants and toddlers in early education and child care programs. The Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics recruited 32 child care centers that care for infants and toddlers to be linked with a child care health consultant (CCHC). Method: Project staff assigned the centers alternately to an immediate intervention or a 1-year delayed intervention (contrast) group. At entry into the project, and then 1 and 2 years later, an evaluator assessed center compliance with 13 standards for infants and toddler care selected from Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards (3rd ed.). Project staff linked the Immediate Intervention centers with a CCHC in Year 1. In Year 2, in a crossover comparison, project staff linked Contrast centers with a CCHC. Results: Working with a CCHC effectively improved compliance with some selected health and safety standards.', 'Background: Patients with obesity are at risk for treatment avoidance and nonadherence. Factors that contribute to engagement in primary health care for patients with obesity are not fully understood. Aim: The purpose of this pilot study was to identify issues associated with engagement in primary health care for patients with obesity. Method: Using qualitativemethodology, 11 patients with a mean body mass index of 40.8 kg/m(2) registered with a primary health care practice were interviewed. Conventional content analysis was used to identify factors that contribute to engagement in primary health care. Results: Barriers and facilitators to engagement in primary health care were categorized into the following themes: availability of resources, importance of the relationship, meaningful communication, feeling judged, lack of privacy, poor communication and limited provider knowledge about obesity. Conclusion: Obesity was identified as a health condition that requires additional considerations for patient engagement in their health care.', 'This paper discusses the role of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) in identifying and solving problems within the health care industry. It reviews current AHCPR activities and details the results of the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey, the recent poll of how people in the United States make choices about health care. A discussion of present quality measurement tools, such as CONQUEST, a database of existing performance measures, includes an outline of plans for developing new measures of quality and outcomes. Also explored are ideas for improving quality measurements, potential problems and risks, and the public role in health services research.', 'Background: After an organizational transformation in the mid-1990s, the quality of care in the Veterans Affairs health-care system (VA) compared favorably with the quality of care in some private-sector settings. Whether this performance advantage has persisted, and also its relation to geographic and socioeconomic variations in care, is unknown. Objective: We compared the quality and equity of care for older adults in the VA with that delivered in Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans using the same performance measures. Research Design: Cross-sectional comparison. Subjects: A total of 293,554 observations from enrollees in 142 VA medical centers (VAMCs) and 5,768,573 observations from enrollees in 305 MA plans. Measurements: Adherence to quality measures assessing diabetes, cardiovascular, and cancer screening care from 2000 to 2007. Results: The VA outperformed MA plans on 10 of 11 quality measures in the initial study year, and on all 12 measures in the final year. In 2006 and 2007, adjusted differences between the VA and MA ranged from 4.3 percentage points (95% CI, 3.2-5.4) for cholesterol testing in coronary heart disease to 30.8 percentage points (95% CI, 28.1-33.5) for colorectal cancer screening. For 9 of 12 measures, socioeconomic disparities (defined as the difference in performance rates between persons in the highest and lowest quartiles of area-level income and education) were lower in the VA than in MA. Across all measures, the mean interquartile range of performance was 6.7 percentage points for VAMCs and 14.5 percentage points for MA plans. Conclusions: Among persons aged 65 years or older, the VA health-care system significantly outperformed private-sector MA plans and delivered care that was less variable by site, geographic region, and socioeconomic status.', 'Background: In Hungary, since 1990, each government has tried to transform and rationalize the structure of health care. One of the reforms was the Care Managing Organization (CMO) programme introduced in 1999. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to describe the regional, environmental, structural and preliminary health related outcomes of the CMO in Bacs-Kiskun County (Central-Eastern Hungary). Methods: First, cardiovascular screening programmes were organized for pre-screened and randomly selected populations of a total of 4462 persons. Seven years after completing the programmes, regional mortality data were analysed and compared. Second, nutritional and lifestyle counselling programmes with increased physical activity were organized for 2489 overweight or obese patients from the participating primary care practices. Anthropometric and laboratory data were examined after one and two years. Results: First, for persons with higher cardiovascular risk, appropriate medical treatment was introduced, and after seven years, their mortality rates proved better than the regional and national data. Second, almost all measured anthropometric parameters improved (body mass index, body weight decrease) after the first year and this trend lasted till the end of the second year. Conclusions: According to the data of the National Health Insurance Fund, the average savings rate for all CMOs for the fiscal years 1999-2007 was 4.94%. The highest rates of savings were realized in chronic and acute inpatient care and medical devices. In the end of 2008, by which time 14 CMOs had already covered 2.1 million people, the programme was discontinued by the government, without a comprehensive evaluation of the experience and outcomes.', 'This article analyzes Dutch experiences of health care reform-in particular in primary care-with emphasis on lessons for current United States health care reforms. Recent major innovations were the introduction of private insurance based on the principles of primary care-led health care and including all citizens irrespective of their financial, employment, or health status; introduction of primary care collaboratives for out-of-hour services and chronic disease management; and primary care team building, including practice nurses. These innovations were introduced on top of a strong primary care tradition of family practices with defined populations based on patient panels, practice-based research, evidence-based medicine, large-scale computerization, and strong primary care health informatics. Dutch health reform redirected payment to support introduction of innovative health plans and strengthening of primary care to respond to public health objectives. Five recommendations for US primary care follow from this Dutch experience: (1) a private insurance model is compatible with thriving primary care, but it must include all people, especially the most vulnerable in society, and espouse a primary care-led health care system; (2) patient panels or practice lists strengthen continuity of care and community orientation to focus on and respond to local needs; (3) reward collaboration within primary care and between primary care, hospital care, and public health; (4) stimulate primary care professionals to exert their passion and expertise through participation in primary care research and development; and (5) health informatics should be primary care based, preferably adopting the International Classification of Primary Care. With these recommendations, it will be possible for the United States to obtain better population health for its population. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012;25:S12-17.)', 'Background: While religious involvement is associated with improvements in health, little is known about the relationship between church participation and health care practices. Objectives: To determine 1) the prevalence of church participation; 2) whether church participation influences positive health care practices; and 3) whether gender, age, insurance status, and levels of comorbidity modified these relationships. Design: A cross-sectional analysis using survey data from 2196 residents of a low-income, African-American neighborhood. Measurements: Our independent variable measured the frequency of church attendance. Dependent variables were: 1) Pap smear; 2) mammogram; and 3) dental visit-all taking place within 2 years; 4) blood pressure measurement within 1 year, 5) having a regular source of care, and 6) no perceived delays in care in the previous year. We controlled for socioeconomic factors and the number of comorbid conditions and also tested for interactions. Results: Thirty-seven percent of community members went to church at least monthly. Church attendance was associated with increased likelihood of positive health care practices by 20% to 80%. In multivariate analyses, church attendance was related to dental visits (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 1.9) and blood pressure measurements (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1). Insurance status and number of comorbid conditions modified the relationship between church attendance and Pap smear, with increased practices noted for the uninsured (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.1) and for women with 2 or more comorbid conditions (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5). Conclusion: Church attendance is an important correlate of positive health care practices, especially for the most vulnerable subgroups, the uninsured and chronically ill. Community- and faith-based organizations present additional opportunities to improve the health of low-income and minority populations.', \"Although many health care reforms have been enacted in the last few years in Germany, many of the key points in the current social health care system have been retained from former times. All those introductions for an effective health care system from the last 150 years beginning with mandatory guild membership via Bismarck's social laws to the modern health care systems in Germany with the current problems of financing the heavy burden in the German budget are reported. Data and facts on the current health care system are provided. In the following two articles of this series ambulatory and inpatient treatment in the light of economic aspects of health care are reported.\", 'We examined racial/ethnic disparities in unmet specialty, dental, mental, and allied health care needs among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) using data on 38,866 children in the National Survey of CSHCN. Compared with White CSHCN, Black CSHCN had significantly greater unmet specialty (9.6% vs. 6.7%), dental (16% vs. 8.7%), and mental (27% vs. 17%) health care needs. Hispanic CSHCN had greater unmet dental care needs (15.8% vs. 8.7%). Black females had greater unmet mental health care needs than other groups (41% vs. 13-20%). Most disparities disappeared after multivariate adjustment. Significant risk factors for unmet health care needs included uninsurance, having no personal doctor/nurse, poverty, and condition stability and severity. Eliminating unmet specialty, dental, and mental health care needs for all CSHCN, and especially minority CSHCN, may require greater efforts to reduce poverty and increase insurance coverage among CSHCN, better mental health care assessment of Black female CSHCN, and ensuring all CSHCN have a medical home.', \"This study intends to map the health care given to the usuary with needs in the mental health field in a primary health care unity, analyzing the team work in the light of the integrate primary health care practices. The participants are health workers from different professions, who belong to the service's mental health working processes. The data collection technique used was the analytic flowchart. The results show us that the connective flows among the professionals and between them and the health unity's, in the primary health care unit, has been producing and proliferated diverse exchanges' spaces, making possible health actions aligned to the integrality in people's care through a enlarged understanding of health mental disease process, by means of human relationships' valuation and subjectivities involved in the health work space.\", \"Purpose: To examine unmet health needs and health care utilization among youth with special health care needs (YSHCN). Methods: We analyzed data among youth aged 12-17 years using the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. We conducted descriptive analyses comparing YSHCN with non-YSHCN, and bivariate and multivariable analyses examining associations between dependent and independent measures. Six dependent variables represented unmet needs and utilization. Adjusted analyses controlled for sociodemographic and health measures. Results: A total of 5,862 individuals were identified as YSHCN, and nearly 70% had three or more comorbid conditions. Over 90% used medical care, preventive care, or dental care in the past 12 months, while 8% reported having unmet health needs (compared with 2.8% of non-YSHCN). Using a typology of qualifying criteria for special health care needs, we found that YSHCN with increasing complexity of needs were more likely to report unmet health needs, use of mental health care services, and emergency department use, compared with YSHCN using medication only to manage their conditions. All YSHCN living in households below 400% federal poverty level were less likely to utilize nearly all types of health care examined, with the exception of mental health care use, compared with those at or above 400% federal poverty level. Conclusions: Differences in complexity of needs, race/ethnicity, and poverty status highlight existing gaps in health care utilization and persistent unmet health needs among YSHCN. Efforts should focus on strengthening coordinated systems of care that optimally meet the needs of YSHCN so they may thrive in their families and communities.

Objective: To describe the reproductive health diagnoses of women Veterans using VA health care, how these diagnoses differ across age groups, and variations in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics by presence of reproductive health diagnoses. Research Design: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of VA administrative and clinical data. Subjects: The study included women Veterans using VA health care in FY10. Measures: Reproductive health diagnoses were identified through presence of International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes in VA clinical and administrative records. The prevalence of specific diagnosis categories were examined by age group (18-44, 45-64, >= 65 y) and the most frequent diagnoses for each age group were identified. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared by presence of at least 1 reproductive health diagnosis. Results: The most frequent reproductive health diagnoses were menstrual disorders and endometriosis among those aged 18-44 years (n = 16,658, 13%), menopausal disorders among those aged 45-64 years (n = 20,707, 15%), and osteoporosis among those aged >= 65 years (n = 8365, 22%). Compared with women without reproductive health diagnoses, those with such diagnoses were more likely to have concomitant mental health (46% vs. 37%, P < 0.001) and medical conditions (75% vs. 63%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Women Veterans using VA health care have diverse reproductive health diagnoses. The high prevalence of comorbid medical and mental health conditions among women Veterans with reproductive health diagnoses highlights the importance of integrating reproductive health expertise into all areas of VA health care, including primary, mental health, and specialty care.', 'Objectives:Identifying routinely recorded markers of poor health in patients with dementia may help treatment decisions and evaluation of earlier outcomes in research. Our objective was to determine whether a set of credible markers of dementia-related health could be identified from primary care electronic health records (EHR). Methods:The study consisted of (i) rapid review of potential measures of dementia-related health used in EHR studies; (ii) consensus exercise to assess feasibility of identifying these markers in UK primary care EHR; (iii) development of UK EHR code lists for markers; (iv) analysis of a regional primary care EHR database to determine further potential markers; (v) consensus exercise to finalise markers and pool into higher domains; (vi) determination of 12-month prevalence of domains in EHR of 2328 patients with dementia compared to matched patients without dementia. Results:Sixty-three markers were identified and mapped to 13 domains: Care; Home Pressures; Severe Neuropsychiatric; Neuropsychiatric; Cognitive Function; Daily Functioning; Safety; Comorbidity; Symptoms; Diet/Nutrition; Imaging; Increased Multimorbidity; Change in Dementia Drug. Comorbidity was the most prevalent recorded domain in dementia (69%). Home Pressures were the least prevalent domain (1%). Ten domains had a statistically significant higher prevalence in dementia patients, one (Comorbidity) was higher in non-dementia patients, and two (Home Pressures, Diet/Nutrition) showed no association with dementia. Conclusions:EHR captures important markers of dementia-related health. Further research should assess if they indicate dementia progression. These markers could provide the basis for identifying individuals at risk of faster progression and outcome measures for use in research.', 'Objective Data Sources/Study Setting Examine how behavioral health (BH) integration affects health care costs, emergency department (ED) visits, and inpatient admissions. Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases. Study Design Data Collection/Extraction Methods Social network analysis identified care communities (providers sharing a high number of patients) and measured BH integration in terms of how connected, or central, BH providers were to other providers in their community. Multivariable generalized linear models adjusting for age, sex, number of prescriptions, and Charlson comorbidity score were used to estimate the relationship between the centrality of BH providers and health care utilization of BH patients. Used outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy claims data from six Medicaid plans from 2011 to 2013 to identify study outcomes, comorbidities, providers, and health care encounters. Principal Findings Conclusions Behavioral health centrality ranged from 0 (no BH providers) to 0.49. Relative to communities at the median BH centrality (0.06), in 2012, BH patients in communities at the 75th percentile of BH centrality (0.31) had 0.2 fewer admissions, 2.1 fewer all-cause ED visits, and accrued $1,947 fewer costs, on average. Increased behavioral centrality was significantly associated with a reduced number of ED visits, less frequent inpatient admissions, and lower overall health care costs.', 'Background. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine commissioned an environmental scan describing the status of health care integration of oral health and primary care services. Methods. The authors conducted an environmental scan of US integration activities with publications from January 2000 through August 2017. They categorized services as preventive oral health services (POHS) provided by medical care providers, POHS provided by dental providers in nondental settings, preventive health services provided by dental providers, or care coordination using dedicated personnel and technology. The authors chose 4 programs as case studies and interviewed key personnel in each program. One case study illustrates each category of integrated services; additional examples describe category variation. Results. The case study involving Into the Mouth of Babes illustrates medical professionals delivering POHS to children. The case study involving Grace Health presents dental hygienists embedded in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic to provide oral screening, prophylaxis, and education to pregnant women. At HealthPartners, medical care providers refer patients with diabetes to dentists and waive copays for periodontal care. The InterCommunity Health Network Coordinated Care Organization uses dedicated patient coordinators, technology, and coordinated payment and referral mechanisms to facilitate care. Conclusions. Integration of dental and medical care increased access to and coordination of patient care by means of offering health care services traditionally provided by the other profession. Practical Implications. Integration models demonstrate the incorporation of POHS by primary care professionals, the embedding of dental professionals into primary care clinics, and the incorporation of care coordination to increase the delivery of oral health care. Similarly, dentists identify and refer patients with medical needs or preventive gaps to medical homes.', 'To obtain information about the actual use of health care facilities by undocumented women and to identify obstacles they experience in accessing health care facilities. A mixed methods study, with structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, was chosen to obtain a complete understanding. One-hundred undocumented women were recruited. Diversity was sought according to age, origin and reason for being undocumented. Undocumented female immigrants have unmet health care needs (56%) and low health care utilisation. Sixty-nine per cent of the women reported obstacles in accessing health care facilities. These included many personal obstacles such as shame, fear and/or lack of information. Poor language proficiency (OR 0.28;. CI 0.09-0.90) reduces utilisation of primary health care services. Health care utilisation of undocumented women is low. Undocumented women refrain from seeking health care because of personal obstacles. These women need to be identified and informed about their rights, the health care system and the duty of professional confidentiality of doctors. Finally, institutional obstacles to access care should be removed since they strengthen reluctance to seek help.', 'Background: Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for all persons to ensure that the care they receive aligns with their values and preferences. Objective: To evaluate an ACP intervention developed to better meet the needs and priorities of persons with chronic diseases, including mild cognitive impairment. Research Design: A year-long, pre-post intervention using lay community health workers [care coordinator assistants (CCAs)] trained to conduct and document ACP conversations with patients during home health visits with pre-post evaluation. Subjects: The 818 patients were 74.2 years old (mean); 78% women; 51% African American; 43% white. Measures: Documentation of ACP conversation in electronic health record fields and health care utilization outcomes. Results: In this target population ACP documentation rose from 3.4% (pre-CCA training) to 47.9% (post) of patients who had at least 1 discussion about ACP in the electronic health record. In the 1-year preintervention period, there were no differences in admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits between patients who did and did not have ACP discussion. After adjusting for prior hospitalization and ED use histories, ACP discussions were associated with a 34% less probability of hospitalization (hazard ratios, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97), and similar effects are apparent on ED use independent of age and prior ED use effects. Conclusions: Patients with chronic diseases including mild cognitive impairment can engage in ACP conversations with trusted home health care providers. Having ACP conversation is associated with significant reduction in seeking urgent health care and in hospitalizations.', \"We review recently published studies of U.S. health policy and the nation's health care system. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, health inequalities were widening and care was inequitably distributed. Although the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion improved access to care and timely cancer diagnoses, a large proportion of U.S. residents continued to avoid medical care due to concerns about costs, and access to mental health services remains particularly inadequate. Yet more evidence of private insurers' profit-driven misbehaviors and of corruption among medical leaders continues to emerge. Misguided incentives and lax regulation encourages nominally nonprofit health care providers to mimic for-profits' misconduct, and rapacious investors own and control an increasing share of physicians' practices. Pharmaceutical firms wield outsize political influence and devote far more funds to rewarding investors than to research and development effort. Yet despite vigorous efforts by pharma and other commercial interests to denigrate national health insurance, polls indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasing support for such reform.\", \"Background: Informal (dementia) care has economic consequences throughout the health care system. Whilst the health and wellbeing of the care recipient might improve, the health of the caregiver might also change, typically for the worse. Therefore, this analysis aims to examine the association between caregiving intensity and caregivers' health and health care utilization. Data and Methods: The empirical analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data generated by the European Project RightTimePlaceCare (RTPC). RTPC was a prospective cohort study conducted in eight European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom). The health status of 1029 informal caregivers was assessed by measures of psychological wellbeing (GHQ-12) and self-rated overall health (EQ-VAS). Health care utilization was measured by (i) the self-stated proportion of health care use influenced by caregiving and (ii) the probability of at least one visit to a general practitioner within in the last 30 days. The association between caregiving intensity and caregivers' health and health care utilization was assessed by descriptive analysis and multivariate OLS- and probit-models. Results: A higher amount of informal care was significantly related to negative health outcomes for informal caregivers. On average, one additional hour of informal caregiving per day was associated with a decrease of psychological wellbeing and self-rated overall health by 0.16 and 0.42 index points respectively. Furthermore, one more hour of informal caregiving corresponded with increased self-stated proportion of health care use by 0.56 percentage points. However, the claim of increased health care demand due to caregiving as measured by GP visits was only partly confirmed. Conclusion: When evaluating the full economic effect of informal care, the impact of providing care on caregivers' health and health care utilization has to be taken into account.

Methods We linked 1,459 community-dwelling women (mean age 83.6 years) participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Year 16 visit (2002-2004) with their Medicare claims. Five dimensions of sleep health (satisfaction, daytime sleepiness, timing, latency, and duration) were assessed by self-report. The number of impaired dimensions was expressed as a score (range 0-5). Total direct health-care costs and utilization were ascertained during the subsequent 36 months. Results Mean (SD) total health-care costs/year (2017 dollars) increased in a graded manner across the sleep health score ranging from $10,745 ($15,795) among women with no impairment to up to $15,332 ($22,810) in women with impairment in three to five dimensions (p = 0.01). After adjustment for age, race, and enrollment site, women with impairment in three to five dimensions vs. no impairment had greater mean total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.34 [95% CI = 1.13 to 1.60]) and appeared to be at higher risk of hospitalization (odds ratio (OR) 1.31 [95% CI = 0.96 to 1.81]). After further accounting for number of medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms, impairment in three to five sleep health dimensions was not associated with total costs (CR 1.02 [95% CI = 0.86 to 1.22]) or hospitalization (OR 0.91 [95% CI = 0.65 to 1.28]). Poor multidimensional sleep health was not related to outpatient costs or risk of skilled nursing facility stay. Conclusions Older women with poor sleep health have higher subsequent total health-care costs largely attributable to their greater burden of medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms.', 'BackgroundPrimary health care and its strengthening through performance measurement is essential for sustainably working towards universal health coverage. Existing performance frameworks and indicators to measure primary health care capture system functions like governance, financing and resourcing but to a lesser extent the function of services delivery and its heterogeneous nature. Moreover, most frameworks have weak links with routine information systems and national health priorities, especially in the context of high- and middle-income countries. This paper presents the development of a tool that responds to this context with the aim to create primary health care performance intelligence for the 53 countries of the WHO European Region.MethodsThe work builds-off of an existing systematic review on primary care and draws on priorities of current European health policies and available (inter)national information systems. Its development included: (i) reviewing and classifying features of primary care; (ii) constructing a set of tracer conditions; and (iii) mapping existing indicators in the framework resulting from (i). The analysis was validated through a series of reviews: in-person meetings with country-nominated focal points and primary care experts; at-distance expert reviews; and, preliminary testing with country informants.ResultsThe resulting framework applies a performance continuum in the classical approach of structures-processes-outcomes spanning 6 domains - primary care structures, model of primary care, care contact, primary care outputs, health system outcomes, and health outcomes - that are further classified by 26 subdomains and 63 features of primary care. A care continuum was developed using a set of 12 tracer conditions. A total of 139 indicators were mapped to the classification, each with an identified data source to safeguard measurability. Individual indicator passports and a glossary of terms were developed to support the standardization of the findings.ConclusionThe resulting framework and suite of indicators, coined the Primary Health Care Impact, Performance and Capacity Tool (PHC-IMPACT), has the potential to be applied in Europe, closing the gap on existing data collection, analysis and use of performance intelligence for decision-making towards primary health care strengthening.', \"Authors analysed materials of the WHO Conference on European Health Care Reforms, Ljubljana Slovenia, 17 - 20 June 1996. International overview of data obteined by reviewing and abstracting WHO background documentation about Analysis of Current Strategies and about Citizens Choice and Patients' Rights were presented. Epidemiological data and international comparison on the current situation in the health care systems and their prospective reforms were aimed to provide a starting point for the mutual exchange of experience among the participants of the International Conference on Bioethics Health Care under Stress in Bratislava, August 1996.\", 'Objective: To compare health behaviors, physical health outcomes, and health care utilization between children with and without ADHD. Method: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data for children with and without ADHD from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. To investigate the association between ADHD and health outcomes, we estimated the adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) in these groups. Results: Among 10,838 children aged 7 to 18 years with and without ADHD, those with ADHD had significantly higher APRs for overall health problems, physical illness, and injuries than those without ADHD. Despite having health care needs, children with ADHD were less likely than those without ADHD to use health care services. However, there were no significant associations between most health behaviors and ADHD. Conclusion: Increased efforts are needed to provide quality health care services to address the medical conditions of children with ADHD and to enhance their health care utilization when needed.', \"OBJECTIVES. We compared patient satisfaction among adults with diabetes treated in a Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system with the satisfaction of patients treated in a county-funded health care system. We also examined whether satisfaction differences reflected differences in the process of patient care. DESIGN. Cross-sectional telephone survey of patients recruited from outpatient clinics. SUBJECTS. Five hundred and thirty eight adults, including 310 patients from 4 VA clinics and 228 patients from 2 county clinics. MEASURES. Overall satisfaction with care and satisfaction with 6 separate dimensions of care were measured using the Employee Health Care Value Survey. RESULTS. VA patients were more satisfied than were county patients overall and with 5 of 6 dimensions of their care. These differences increased when we adjusted for patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. VA patients reported more diabetes counseling and shorter waiting times to see their doctor. Each of these self-reported process measures was positively correlated with satisfaction and, when taken into account, reduced the differences in satisfaction between the two systems. However, even when we controlled both for patient characteristics and the process of care, VA patients still were more satisfied than were county patients with their care overall as well as with their access to care, communication with providers, and the quality of their health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS. In this study, VA patients with diabetes were more satisfied with their health care than were county patients. Perceived diabetes-related counseling and shorter waiting times contributed to differences between the systems in patient satisfaction but did not explain them completely.\", 'Background: In the Netherlands, ethnic minority populations visit their general practitioner (GP) more often than the indigenous population. An explanation for this association is lacking. Recently, health literacy is suggested as a possible explaining mechanism. Internationally, associations between health literacy and health care use, and between ethnicity and health literacy have been studied separately, but, so far, have not been linked to each other. In the Netherlands, some expectations have been expressed with regard to supposed low health literacy of ethnic minority groups, however, no empirical study has been done so far. The objectives of this study are therefore to acquire insight into the level of health literacy of ethnic minorities in the Netherlands and to examine whether the relationship between ethnicity and health care use can be (partly) explained by health literacy. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to a sample of 2.116 members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (response rate 46%, 89 respondents of non-western origin). Health literacy was measured with the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) which covers nine different domains. The health literacy levels of ethnic minority groups were compared to the indigenous population. A negative binomial regression model was used to estimate the association between ethnicity and GP visits. To examine whether health literacy is an explaining factor in this association, health literacy and interaction terms of health literacy and ethnicity were added into the model. Results: Differences in levels of health literacy were only found between the Turkish population and the indigenous Dutch population. This study also found an association between ethnicity and GP visits. Ethnic minorities visit their GP 33% more often than the indigenous population. Three domains of the HLQ (the ability to navigate the health care system, the ability to find information and to read and understand health information) partly explained the association between ethnicity and GP visits. Conclusions: In general, there are no differences in health literacy between most of the ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands and the indigenous Dutch population. Only the Turkish population scored significantly lower on several health literacy domains. Some domains of health literacy do explain the association between ethnicity and higher frequency of GP visits. Further research is recommended to understand the pathways through which health literacy impacts health care use.', \"The lockdown restrictions that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic have reshaped the way people live, work, and interact with each other. At the same time, it changed the way health-care professionals and national health-care systems around the world are fighting in this battle for public health. Social media (SoMe) have played their informational role in this fight with almost one-third of the world's population being active users of social media platforms. Contemporary health-care systems have tried to find ways to engage more actively with SoMe as Internet users are increasingly searching for health information on social media platforms. As a result, new demand-side levers arise in the health-care sector along with new opportunities and risks for the stakeholders. Our study looked into the responses of 173 health-care professionals in Greece. SoMe are here to stay and the majority of health-care professionals embrace them in their professional lives. Quality in health information and the work context of Greek health-care professionals in our cohort contribute to attitudes and perceptions of social media use in health care.\", \"Introduction: Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) are the most common complication of pregnancy and have been found to have long-term implications for both mother and child. In vulnerable patient populations such as those served at Denver Health, a federally qualified health center the prevalence of PMADs is nearly double the nationally reported rate of 15-20%. Nearly 17% of women will be diagnosed with major depression at some point in their lives and those numbers are twice as high in women who live in poverty. Women also appear to be at higher risk for depression in the child-bearing years. In order to better address these issues, an Integrated Perinatal Mental Health program was created to screen, assess, and treat PMADs in alignment with national recommendations to improve maternal-child health and wellness. This program was built upon a national model of Integrated Behavioral Health already in place at Denver Health. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of physicians, behavioral health providers, public health, and administrators was assembled at Denver Health, an integrated hospital and community health care system that serves as the safety net hospital to the city and county of Denver, CO. This team was brought together to create a universal screen-to-treat process for PMAD's in perinatal clinics and to adapt the existing Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) model into a program better suited to the health system's obstetric population. Universal prenatal and postnatal depression screening was implemented at the obstetric intake visit, a third trimester prenatal care visit, and at the postpartum visit across the clinical system. At the same time, IBH services were implemented across our health system's perinatal care system in a stepwise fashion. This included our women's care clinics as well as the family medicine and pediatric clinics. These efforts occurred in tandem to support all patients and staff enabling a specially trained behavioral health provider (psychologists and L.C.S.W.'s) to respond immediately to any positive screen during or after pregnancy. Results: In August 2014 behavioral health providers were integrated into the women's care clinics. In January 2015 universal screening for PMADs was implemented throughout the perinatal care system. Screening has improved from 0% of women screened at the obstetric care intake visit in August 2014 to >75% of women screened in August 2016. IBH coverage by a licensed psychologist or licensed clinical social worker exists in 100% of perinatal clinics as of January 2016. As well, in order to gain sustainability, the ability to bill same day visits as well as to bill, and be reimbursed for screening and assessment visits, continues to improve and provide for a model that is self-sustaining for the future. Conclusion: Implementation of a universal screening process for PMADs alongside the development of an IBH model in perinatal care has led to the creation of a program that is feasible and has the capacity to serve as a national model for improving perinatal mental health in vulnerable populations.\", 'Introduction: We investigated the size profile of US primary care and behavioral health physician practices since size may impact the ability to institute care management processes (CMPs) that can enhance care quality. Method: We utilized 2009 claims data from a nationwide commercial insurer to estimate practice size by linking providers by tax identification number. We determined the proportion of primary care physicians, psychiatrists, and behavioral health providers practicing in venues of > 20 providers per practice (the lower bound for current CMP practice surveys). Results: Among primary care physicians (n = 350,350), only 2.1% of practices consisted of > 20 providers. Among behavioral health practitioners (n = 146,992) and psychiatrists (n = 44,449), 1.3% and 1.0% of practices, respectively, had > 20 providers. Sensitivity analysis excluding single-physician practices as secondary confirmed findings, with primary care and psychiatrist practices of > 20 providers comprising, respectively, only 19.4% and 8.8% of practices (difference: P < 0.0001). In secondary analyses, bipolar disorder was used as a tracer condition to estimate practice census for a high-complexity, high-cost behavioral health condition; only 1.3-18 patients per practice had claims for this condition. Conclusions: The tax identification number method for estimating practice size has strengths and limitations that complement those of survey methods. The proportion of practices below the lower bound of prior CMP studies is substantial, and care models and policies will need to address the needs of such practices and their patients. Achieving a critical mass of patients for disorder-specific CMPs will require coordination across multiple small practices.', 'In the past 2 decades, societal spending on health care has become an international concern. The United States currently spends more than 1.6 trillion dollars per year on health care approximately 15% of the gross domestic product. The provision of care to critically ill patients accounts for a disproportionate share of these health care dollars-approximately 13% of hospital costs, 4% of national health expenditures, and 0.5% to 1% of the gross domestic product. This enormous investment necessitates careful evaluation of our interventions and their associated expense. Economic evaluation can aid policy makers and health care professionals in comparing the relative and incremental value of disparate and expensive therapies and also inform decisions about which interventions provide good value for the health care dollar. In this review, we will highlight landmark publications over the past 3 decades that have helped to shape the field of economic evaluation for critical care medicine.', 'There is a need for a paradigm shift across mental health in primary care to improve the lives of millions of Europeans. To contribute to this paradigm shift, the European Forum for Primary Care (EFPC-MH) working group for Mental Health, produced a Position Paper for Primary Care Mental Health outlining 14 themes that needed prioritizing. These themes were developed and discussed interactively during the EFPC conferences between 2012 and 2019. The Position Paper on Mental Health gives direction to the necessary improvements over the next ten years. The themes vary from preferable healthcare model to the social determinants highlighting issues such as inequalities. The Statement of Mental Health in Primary Care will be established in cooperation with fellow organizations.', 'Background: Public health and primary care are distinct sectors within western health care systems. Within each sector, work is carried out in the context of organizations, for example, public health units and primary care clinics. Building on a scoping literature review, our study aimed to identify the influencing factors within these organizations that affect the ability of these health care sectors to collaborate with one another in the Canadian context. Relationships between these factors were also explored. Methods: We conducted an interpretive descriptive qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with 74 key informants from three provinces, one each in western, central and eastern Canada, and others representing national organizations, government, or associations. The sample included policy makers, managers, and direct service providers in public health and primary care. Results: Seven major organizational influencing factors on collaboration were identified: 1) Clear Mandates, Vision, and Goals; 2) Strategic Coordination and Communication Mechanisms between Partners; 3) Formal Organizational Leaders as Collaborative Champions; 4) Collaborative Organizational Culture; 5) Optimal Use of Resources; 6) Optimal Use of Human Resources; and 7) Collaborative Approaches to Programs and Services Delivery. Conclusion: While each influencing factor was distinct, the many interactions among these influences are indicative of the complex nature of public health and primary care collaboration. These results can be useful for those working to set up new or maintain existing collaborations with public health and primary care which may or may not include other organizations.', \"Introduction: In 2007, a substantial reform changed the administrative boundaries of the Danish health care system and introduced health care agreements to be signed between municipal and regional authorities. To assess the health care agreements as a tool for coordinating health and social services, a survey was conducted before (2005-2006) and after the reform (2011). Theory and methods: The study was designed on the basis of a modified version of Alter and Hage's framework for conceptualising coordination. Both surveys addressed all municipal level units (n = 271/98) and a random sample of general practitioners (n = 700/853). Results: The health care agreements were considered more useful for coordinating care than the previous health plans. The power relationship between the regional and municipal authorities in drawing up the agreements was described as more equal. Familiarity with the agreements among general practitioners was higher, as was the perceived influence of the health care agreements on their work. Discussion: Health care agreements with specific content and with regular follow-up and systematic mechanisms for organising feedback between collaborative partners exemplify a useful tool for the coordination of health and social services. Conclusion: There are substantial improvements with the new health agreements in terms of formalising a better coordination of the health care system.\", \"Background: While previous research has suggested that health care assistants supporting palliative care work in the community regard the provision of emotional labour as a key aspect of their role, little research has explored the experiences of family carers who are the recipients of such support. Objective: To explore the emotional labour undertaken by health care assistants working in community palliative care from the perspectives of both health care assistants and bereaved family carers. Design: We conducted a qualitative interview study in 2011-2012 with bereaved family carers of cancer patients who had received the services of health care assistants in the community, and health care assistants who provided community palliative care services. Transcripts were coded and analysed for emergent themes using a constant comparative technique. Settings: Three different research sites in the United Kingdom, all providing community palliative care. Participants and methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 bereaved family carers and eight health care assistants. Results: Health care assistants view one of their key roles as providing emotional support to patients and their family carers, and family carers recognise and value this emotional support. Emotional support by health care assistants was demonstrated in three main ways: the relationships which health care assistants developed and maintained on the professional personal boundary; the ability of health care assistants to negotiate clinical/ domestic boundaries in the home; the ways in which health care assistants and family carers worked together to enable the patient to die at home. Conclusion: Through their emotional labour, health care assistants perform an important role in community palliative care which is greatly valued by family carers. While recent reports have highlighted potential dangers in the ambiguity of their role, any attempts to clarify the 'boundaries' of the health care assistant role should acknowledge the advantages health care assistants can bring in bridging potential gaps between healthcare professionals and family carers.

It has been estimated that there were 28 million cancer survivors around the world in 2012. In the UK, for patients diagnosed in 2007, it is predicted that more than half of them will survive their cancer for 5 years or more. A large majority of cancer survivors report unmet supportive care needs and distressing symptoms and adverse long-term consequences related to their cancer. Cancer management could be optimized to better meet patients demand through technology, including mobile health (m-Health). m-Health is defined as the use of mobile communications and network technologies for health care. m-Health can help both patients and health-care professionals and play an important part in managing and delivering cancer care including managing side effects, supporting drug adherence, providing cancer information, planning and follow up and detecting and diagnosing cancer. Health authorities have already published guidelines regulating m-Health to insure patient safety and improve the accountability of its applications.', 'Objective: For patients with an initial primary care (PC) encounter in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that included a mental health diagnosis, we evaluate whether same-day receipt of Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) services is associated with the likelihood of receiving a subsequent mental-health-related encounter in the following 90 days. Method: Using VHA administrative data, we identified 9046 patients who received VHA care for the first time in fiscal year 2009, received a PC encounter that included a mental health diagnosis on the first day of their VHA services and initiated care at a VHA facility that provided PC-MHI services. Using multivariable generalized estimating equations logistic regression, we examined whether receipt of same-day PC-MHI was associated with receipt of a subsequent encounter with a mental health diagnosis within 90 days. Analyses adjusted for Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran status, demographic characteristics, service-connected disability, psychiatric and non-psychiatric diagnoses, and psychotropic medication initiation on the index day of service use. Results: Receipt of same-day PC-MHI services was positively associated with having a mental-health-related encounter in the following 90 days (adjusted odds ratio=2.05; 95% confidence interval=1.66-2.54). Conclusions: PC-MHI services may enhance mental health continuation of care among PC patients with mental health conditions who initiate VHA services. Published by Elsevier Inc.', \"This study reports on a statewide survey of medical and behavioral health professionals to advance the knowledge base on the benefits and obstacles to delivering integrated pediatric health care. Surveys distributed in 3 statewide provider networks were completed by 110 behavioral health specialists (BHSs) and 111 primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey content documented their perceptions about key services, benefits, barriers, and needed opportunities related to integrated care. Factor analyses identified 8 factors, and other items were examined individually. We compared responses by specialty group (BHS vs PCP) and integrated care experience (no vs yes). The findings revealed differences across domains by specialty subgroup. In several cases, BHS (vs PCP) respondents, especially those with integrated care experience, reported lower benefits, higher barriers, and fewer resource requests. The implications of these results for enhancing care integration development, delivery, training, and research are discussed along with the study's limitations and empirical literature.\", 'Evidence of the health-promoting influence of primary care has been accumulating ever since researchers have been able to distinguish primary care from other aspects of the health services delivery system. This evidence shows that primary care helps prevent illness and death, regardless of whether the care is characterized by supply of primary care physicians, a relationship with a source of primary care, or the receipt of important features of primary care. The evidence also shows that primary care (in contrast to specialty care) is associated with a more equitable distribution of health in populations, a finding that holds in both cross-national and within-national studies. The means by which primary care improves health have been identified, thus suggesting ways to improve overall health and reduce differences in health across major population subgroups.', \"Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and hospitals are investing in improving !'population health, by which they nearly always mean the health of the population of patients attributed by Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurers to their organizations. But population health can and should also mean the health of the entire population in a geographic area. We present arguments for and against ACOs and hospitals investing in affecting the socioeconomic determinants of health to improve the health of the population in their geographic area, and we provide examples of ACOs and hospitals that are doing so in a limited way. These examples suggest that ACOs and hospitals can work with other organizations in their community to improve population health. We briefly present recent proposals for such coalitions and for how they could be financed to be sustainable.\", \"Objective. The absence of a more significant improvement in cancer survival in countries such as the UK and Denmark may be partly rooted in delayed care-seeking among cancer patients. Past research on patient delay has mainly focused on patient characteristics (e. g. sociodemographic and psychological factors and symptom recognition) as causes of delayed care-seeking, while few studies have examined how the organizational structure of health care systems may influence patients' reflections on seeking care. The aim of this study was to explore this relationship. Design. The analysis presented is based on semi-structured interviews with 30 cancer patients and their families. Results. The article raises two hypotheses on the relationship between structural elements of a health care system and people's reflections on seeking health care: (1) Gatekeeping introduces an asymmetrical relationship between the patient and the GP which potentially results in self-restricting care-seeking, (2) Continuity in the doctor-patient relationship may negatively influence patient reflections on access to health care, as the focus shifts from the medical issues of the consultation to reflections on how to properly interact with the GP and the system in which she/he is situated. Conclusion. It is concluded that these hypotheses form a sound basis for further primary care research on how the organizational structure of health care systems influences patient reflections on access to medical care.\", \"Children with medical complexity have high health service utilization and health expenditures that can impose significant financial burdens. This study examined these issues for families with children enrolled in US private health plans. Using IBM Watson/Truven Analytics MarketScan (R) commercial claims and encounters data (2012-2014), we analyzed through regression models, the differences in health care utilization and spending of disaggregated health care services by health plan types and children's medical complexity levels. Children in consumer-driven and high-deductible plans had much higher out-of-pocket spending and cost shares than those in health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Children with complex chronic conditions had higher service utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures while having lower cost shares on various categories of services than those without any chronic condition. Compared to families covered by PPOs, those with high-deductible or consumer-driven plans were 2.7 and 1.7 times more likely to spend over US$1000 out of pocket on their children's medical care, respectively. Families with higher complexity levels were more likely to experience financial burdens from expenditures on children's medical services. In conclusion, policymakers and families with children need to be cognizant of the significant financial burdens that can arise from children's complex medical needs and health plan demand-side cost sharing.\", \"Objective To explore why and how health systems are engaging in care delivery redesign (CDR)-defined as the variety of tools and organizational change processes health systems use to pursue the Triple Aim. Study Setting A purposive sample of 24 health systems across 4 states as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Comparative Health System Performance Initiative. Study Design An exploratory qualitative study design to gain an on the ground understanding of health systems' motivations for, and approaches to, CDR, with the goals of identifying key dimensions of CDR, and gauging the depth of change that is possible based on the particular approaches to redesign care being adopted by the health systems. Data Collection Semi-structured telephone interviews with health system executives and physician organization leaders from 24 health systems (n = 162). Principal Findings We identify and define 13 CDR activities and find that the health systems' efforts are varied in terms of both the combination of activities they are engaging in and the depth of innovation within each activity. Health system executives who report strong internal motivation for their CDR efforts describe more confidence in their approach to CDR than those who report strong external motivation. Health system leaders face uncertainty when implementing CDR due to a limited evidence base and because of the slower than expected pace of payment change. Conclusions The ability to validly and reliably measure CDR activities-particularly across varying organizational contexts and markets-is currently limited but is key to better understanding CDR's impact on intended outcomes, which is important for guiding both health system decision making and policy making.\", \"Background: Maternal mental health problems affect up to 20% of women, with potentially deleterious effects to the mother and family. To address this serious problem, a Maternal Mental Health Program (MMHP) using a shared care approach was developed. Ashared care approach can promote an efficient use of limited specialized maternal mental health services, strengthen collaboration between the maternal mental health care team and primary care physicians, increase access to maternal mental health care services, and promote primary care provider competence in treating maternal mental health problems. Aim: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of a MMHP using a shared care approach on maternal anxiety and depression symptoms of participants, the satisfaction of women and referring physicians, and whether the program met the intents of shared care approach (such as quick consultation, increased knowledge, and confidence of primary care physicians). Methods: We used a pre and post cross-sectional study design to evaluate women's depression and anxiety symptoms and the satisfaction of women and their primary care health provider with the program. Findings: Depression and anxiety symptoms significantly improved with involvement with the program. Women and physicians reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. Physician knowledge and confidence treating maternal mental health problems improved. Conclusions: Shared care can be an effective and efficient way to provide maternal mental health care in primary health care settings where resources are limited.\", 'We consider an economy where most of the health care is publicly provided, and where there is waiting time for several types of treatments. Private health care without waiting time is an option for the patients in the public health queue. We show that although patients with low waiting costs will choose public treatment, they may be better off with waiting time than without. The reason is that waiting time induces patients with high waiting costs to choose private treatment, thus reducing the cost of public health care that everyone pays for. Even if higher quality (i.e. zero waiting time) can be achieved at no cost, the self-selection induced redistribution may imply that it is socially optimal to provide health care publicly and at an inferior quality level. We give a detailed discussion of the circumstances in which it is optimal to have waiting time for public health treatment. Moreover, we study the interaction between this quality decision and the optimal tax/subsidy on private health care. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from South Korea, where daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and parents-in-law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a parent-in-law with functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that parent-in-law, but a parent-in-law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter-in-law's health. We compare results for the daughter-in-law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of the instruments for the daughter sample. Our results show that providing informal care has significant adverse effects along multiple dimensions of health for daughter-in-law and daughter caregivers in South Korea.

When behavioral health integration services were offered only to Medicare patients, net revenue was higher under CoCM (averaging $25,026 per MD in year 1 and $28,548/year in subsequent years) than PCBM (-$7052 in year 1 and -$3706/year in subsequent years). When behavioral health integration services were offered to all patients and were reimbursed by Medicare and private payers, only practices adopting the CoCM approach consistently gained net revenues. The outcomes of the model were sensitive to rates of patient referral acceptance, presentation, and therapy completion, but the CoCM approach remained consistently financially viable whereas PCBM would not be in the long-run across practice types. New Medicare payments may offer financial viability for primary care practices to integrate behavioral health services, but this viability depends on the approach toward care integration.', \"Public Significance Statement Frontline health care workers in the era of COVID-19 need access to emotional support services. This article provides a framework to guide health care institutions in developing emotional and mental health supports for their workforce during these unprecedented times. Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are experiencing a range of emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including anxiety, traumatic stress, and burnout. As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or stepped care model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs. Employing the MESH Framework may also facilitate health care institutions' ability to meet the fourth aim of the Quadruple Aims of Health Care to ensure a healthy workforce for this and future crises.\", 'The most important predictor of quality of health care across all racial and ethnic groups is access, especially insurance status and the ability to pay for health care. If we consider populations with equal access to health care, two groups emerge with differing qualities of health care: non-minority and minority populations. When studies control for the stage of disease at presentation, comorbidities, severity of illness, and other variables, substantial differences in health care based on race and ethnicity can still be found. Raising the consciousness of this issue is an important step toward recognizing and eliminating health care disparities.', 'Many children are treated for mental health disorders in primary care settings. The system of care (SOC) provides a framework for collaboration among pediatric mental health providers, but it is unclear if youth treated for mental health disorders in primary care receive such coordination. At the South Boston Community Health Center from September /2012 to August 2013 for 74 individuals 18 years, the odds of contact with SOC agencies (mental health, education, child protective services, juvenile justice and developmental disabilities) were compared for mental health treatment in primary versus specialty care. The odds of SOC contact within primary care were lower compared to specialty care (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.29-0.66), specifically for mental health (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.25-1.2), education (OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.050-0.28), and child protective services (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.22-1.9). As care coordination may improve health outcomes, increased support and education for care coordination specific to youth treated for mental health disorders in primary care settings may be warranted.', \"In 1999, the multidisciplinary Tavistock group prepared a generic statement of ethical principles to govern health care systems. This paper elaborates on these principles in two directions. First, it develops a set of quality standards, based on ethical principles, intended to regulate health care delivery and service management. Second, it focuses them on 'publicly oriented' (not necessarily governmental) as opposed to 'for profit' (not necessarily private) services. We propose ten principles or quality standards for these services, part of which relate to the individual patients, others to the community. They are political as well as technical, and can be used to inspire health policies, contracts issued by governments, and identification of partners by aid agencies. We analyse their application in key areas of health care by publicly oriented and for-profit health care organizations standards in developing countries, and conclude that the latter are unlikely to adopt the proposed standards. We further elaborate on the implications of the standards for publicly oriented services, focusing on care delivery and patient-centred care, family and community medicine, services management and disease control. Using these criteria for a renewed compact between authorities, health professionals and communities may help to motivate health professionals by bridging the gap between their professional and social-political identity.

This paper describes an underserved rural community in which health care initiatives increased access to comprehensive care. Over a three-year period, use of preventive services increased, whereas emergency room visits and hospitalizations at the community hospital decreased. Low birthweight, risk of congenital syphilis and childhood tuberculosis, and child mortality all decreased. Provision of comprehensive services was met with increased use of preventive health care and improved health outcomes in this rural community.', 'Background: Primary care providers (PCP) differ in their ability to address the needs and reduce use of costly services among complex Medicaid beneficiaries. Among PCPs, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded health centers (HCs) are shown to provide high-value care. Objective: We compared health care utilization of complex Medicaid managed care beneficiaries whose PCPs were HCs versus 3 other groups. Research Design: Cross-sectional study using propensity score matching comparing health care use by provider type, controlling for demographics, health status, and other covariates. Subjects: California Medicaid administrative data for complex adult managed care beneficiaries with at least 1 primary care visit in 2018. Measures: Primary and specialty care evaluation & management visits and services; emergency department (ED) visits; and hospitalizations. PCPs included HCs, clinics not funded by HRSA, solo, and group practice providers. Results: HRSA-funded HCs had lower predicted rates of specialty evaluation & management and other services than all others; lower predicted probability of any ED visits than clinics not funded by HRSA [54% (95% CI: 53%-55%) vs. 56% (95% CI: 55%-57%)] and group practice providers [51% (95% CI: 51%-52%) vs. 52% (95% CI: 52%-53%)]; and lower PP of any hospitalizations than solo [20% (95% CI: 19%-20%) vs. 23% (95% CI: 22%-24%)] and group practice providers [21% (95% CI: 20%-21%) vs. 24% (95% CI: 23%-24%)]. Conclusions: Differences in HC care delivery and practices were associated with lower use of specialty, ED, and hospitalization visits compared with other PCPs for complex Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. Understanding the underlying reasons for these utilization differences may promote better outcomes among these patients.', 'Objectives. To explore the effects of community-level factors an access to any behavioral health care and specialty behavioral health care. Data. Healthcare for Communities household survey data, merged to supplemental data from the 1990 Census Area Resource File, 1995 U.S. Census Bureau Small Area Estimates, and 1994 HMO enrollment data. Study Design. We use a random intercept model to estimate the influences of community-level factors on access to any outpatient care, any behavioral health care conditional on having received outpatient care, and any specialty behavioral health care conditional on having received behavioral health care. Data Collection. HCC data were collected in 1997 from about 10,000 households nationwide but clustered in 60 sites. Principal Findings. Individuals in areas with greater HMO presence have better overall access to care, which in turn affects access to behavioral health care; individuals in poorer communities have less access to specialty care compared to individuals in wealthier communities. Conclusions. Our findings of lower access to specialty care among those in poor communities raises concerns about the appropriateness and quality of the behavioral health care they are receiving. More generally, the findings suggest the importance of considering the current status and expected evolution of HMO penetration and the income level in a community when devising health care policy.', \"Basically, the workshop aims to raise and collect input to Part 2 (Health care process and workflow), currently under development, of the European standard EN 13940 Health informatics - System of concepts to support continuity of care, the general objective of which is to enable communication at the semantic level between information systems in health care in the perspective of continuity of care. Its scope encompasses identifying the various processes and process objects involved, taking into consideration resource management aspects, responsibilities of health care providers, and means for patients' participation. While the process description and concept system model is meant as a tool for the development of information systems, it may also be used for enterprise analysis and form the basis for organizational decisions and more widely organizational developments that are not inherently tied to the use of ICT.\", \"Background Many countries worldwide have experienced reductions in provision of formal long-term care services amidst rising need for care. Provision of unpaid care, meanwhile, has grown. This includes care provided by young people. Care responsibilities can affect a young people's health, education and employment. We aimed to investigate the impacts on the employment and health of young people aged 16 to 25 of providing care, and the associated individual and public expenditure costs. Methods We examined employment, earnings and health impacts for individuals, and a range of economic impacts for society, focusing on young people aged 16 to 25 providing unpaid care in England. We applied regression analysis to data from three waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2013/2015, 2014/2016, and 2015/2017) to compare employment and health outcomes among carers and non-carers, and two-part Generalised Linear Models to estimate costs. To address potential selection bias, we then used propensity score matching methods to explore outcomes for a matched sub-sample of young adult carers who started providing care at baseline (2014/16). Results Young people aged 16 to 25 who provided care at baseline (2014/16) were less likely to be in employment, had lower earnings from paid employment, and had poorer mental and physical health at follow-up (2015/17) compared to young people of the same age who were not providing care at baseline.. There were substantial costs to the state of young adults providing care from lower tax revenue, welfare benefit payments, and health service use. In aggregate, these costs amounted to 1048 pound million annually in 2017. Conclusions High individual impacts and costs to the state of providing unpaid care, and the potential of such impacts to compound existing inequalities, have many implications for policy and practice in the health, social care, employment and welfare benefits sectors. In particular, the findings reinforce the case for reducing the need for young people to provide unpaid care, for example through better provision of formal care services, and to provide ongoing support for those young people whodoprovide care. As impacts are seen in a number of domains, support needs to be multidimensional.\", 'Most health care quality improvement efforts target measures of health care structures, processes, and/or outcomes. Structural measures examine relatively fixed aspects of health care delivery such as physical plant and human resources. Process measures, the focus of the largest proportion of quality improvement efforts, assess specific transactions in clinical-patient encounters, such as use of appropriate surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, which are expected to improve outcomes. Outcome measures, which comprise quality of life endpoints as well as morbidity and mortality, are of greatest interest to clinicians and patients, but entail the greatest complexity, as the majority of variance in outcomes is attributable to patient and environmental factors that may not be readily modifiable. Selecting among structure, process, and outcome measures for quality improvement efforts generally will be dictated by the specific clinical situation for which improvement is desired. One aspect of health care quality that has received a great deal of attention in recent years is the relationship between Surgical volume and health outcomes. Volume, an inherent characteristic of a health care facility or provider, is generally considered a structural measure of quality. Many studies have demonstrated a positive association between volume and outcomes, and policymakers in the private and public sectors have begun to consider volume in certification and reimbursement decisions. The volume-outcome association is not without controversy, however. Most studies in the field are limited by the nature of the administrative data on which they are based, and some Studies have found that variation in quality within volume quantiles exceeds differences between quantiles. Moreover, regionalization driven by a focus on volume may exert adverse effects on access to care. The movement for health care quality improvement faces substantial methodological, clinical, financial, and political challenges. Despite these challenges, it is a movement that is gaining momentum, and the emphasis on quality in health care delivery is likely only to increase in the future. It is crucial, therefore, that physicians assume increasing leadership roles in efforts to define, measure, report, and improve quality of care. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Research methods: We conducted 36 qualitative interviews with neonatal health care providers and hospital administrators and analysed data using a descriptive interpretive approach. Setting: 10 Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units in a single, integrated health care system in one Canadian province. Findings: Three major themes emerged: (1) providing family-centred care, (2) working amidst health care system challenges, and (3) recommending improvements to the health care system. The overarching theme was that the health care system was making 'too much noise' for health care providers and hospital administrators to provide family-centred care in waysthat would benefit infants and their families. Recommended improvements included: refining staffing models, enhancing professional development, providing tools to deliver consistent care, recognising parental capacity to be involved in care, strengthening continuity of care, supporting families to be with their infant, and designing family-friendly environments. Conclusion: When implementing family-centred care initiatives, health care providers and hospital administrators need to consider the complexity of providing care in Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units, and recognise that health care system changes may be necessary to optimise implementation.

We used a quasi-experimental design with difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses to examine changes in preventative health care delivery over 3 time periods in Medicaid expansion compared with nonexpansion states.Subjects:We included low-income (<138% federal poverty level) nonelderly (age younger than 65y) adults residing in 46 US states.Measures:Our predictor was residing in a Medicaid expansion state (24 states) versus nonexpansion state (19 states). Our primary outcomes were preventative health care services, which we categorized as cancer screening (breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer); cardiovascular risk reduction (serum cholesterol screening in low-risk groups, serum cholesterol monitoring in high-risk groups, and aspirin use); diabetes care (serum cholesterol monitoring, hemoglobin A1c monitoring, foot examination, eye examination, and influenza vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination); and other primary care measures [influenza vaccination, alcohol use screening, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening].Results:Survey responses from 500,495 low-income nonelderly adults from 2012 to 2017 were included in the analysis, representing 68.2 million US adults per year. Of the 15 outcomes evaluated, we did not detect statistically significant differences in cancer screening (3 outcomes), cholesterol screening or monitoring (2 outcomes), diabetes care (6 outcomes), or alcohol use screening (1 outcome) in expansion compared with nonexpansion states. Aspirin use (DiD 8.8%, P<0.001), influenza vaccination (DiD 1.4%, P=0.016), and HIV screening (DiD 1.9%, P=0.004) increased in expansion states compared with nonexpansion states.Conclusions:Medicaid expansion was associated with an increase in aspirin use, influenza vaccination, and HIV screening in expansion states. Despite improvements in access to care, including health insurance, having a primary care doctor, and routine visits, Medicaid expansion was not associated with improvements in cancer screening, cholesterol monitoring, diabetes care, or alcohol use screening. Our findings highlight implementation challenges in delivering high-quality primary care to low-income populations.', \"As interprofessional education (IPE) becomes more common in student training programs, reliable and valid scales are needed to measure students' perceptions of the experience. The Attitudes Toward Health Care Teams Scale (ATHCTS) was developed to measure students' attitudes toward IPE programs using 14 items loaded on two factors. In this paper, we used the ATHCTS scale to assess the effects of a three-semester long health care IPE program on three cohorts of nurse practitioner, occupational therapy, and physical therapy graduate students with three measurement points across two university sites (N = 367). Confirmatory factor analysis on the baseline data of the first cohort revealed unacceptable fit indices; in addition, not all items were applicable, some items had double or low factor loadings, and positively and negatively worded items loaded on separate factors, indicating potential answering bias, and both factors were highly correlated. We thus conducted further item analyses and propose a short version of the ATHCTS using six items with one reverse coded item, describing the quality of interprofessional care in a more parsimonious way. The factor structure of the six-item version was tested using confirmatory factor analysis on the baseline data of cohort 2 and 3. Results were compared to the 14-item version, and fit indices confirmed a better fit to the data than the old version. Using the shortened scale, student attitudes were compared over the course of the program and between both sites. Results showed that site 2 students' attitudes remained very positive over time, while site 1 students' attitudes declined significantly. We suggest this finding is related to the consistency of team membership at site 2 and discuss the implications for IPE program design.\", 'Health care delivery and payment systems are moving rapidly toward value-based care. To be successful in this new environment, providers must consistently deliver high-quality, evidence-based, and coordinated care to patients. This study assesses whether Project ECHO (R) (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) GEMH (geriatric mental health)a remote learning and mentoring program-is an effective strategy to address geriatric mental health challenges in rural and underserved communities. Thirty-three teleECHO clinic sessions connecting a team of specialists to 54 primary care and case management spoke sites (approximately 154 participants) were conducted in 10 New York counties from late 2014 to early 2016. The curriculum consisted of case presentations and didactic lessons on best practices related to geriatric mental health care. Twenty-six interviews with program participants were conducted to explore changes in geriatric mental health care knowledge and treatment practices. Health insurance claims data were analyzed to assess changes in health care utilization and costs before and after program implementation. Findings from interviews suggest that the program led to improvements in clinician geriatric mental health care knowledge and treatment practices. Claims data analysis suggests that emergency room costs decreased for patients with mental health diagnoses. Patients without a mental health diagnosis had more outpatient visits and higher prescription and outpatient costs. Telementoring programs such as Project ECHO GEMH may effectively build the capacity of frontline clinicians to deliver high-quality, evidence-based care to older adults with mental health conditions and may contribute to the transformation of health care delivery systems from volume to value.', \"Focusing on key principles and objectives of the health care reform in Austria, financing, planning, and decision-making within the new structures are discussed.

We sought to evaluate the association between acute care utilization and health care expenditures and to identify characteristics associated with high spending. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicaid-enrolled children 1-21 years old from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016. Children were categorized by acute care use (including emergency department and urgent care visits) as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more visits. Our main outcomes were annualized spending, total per-member-per-year spending, and acute care-related per-member-per-year spending. Results There were 5.1 million Medicaid-enrolled children that comprised the study cohort, accounting for US $32.6 billion in total spending. Children with 4 or more acute care visits were more likely to be younger than 2 years or older than 14 years, female, and have a chronic condition. Children with 4 or more acute care visits consisted of only 4% of the cohort but accounted for 15% (US $4.7 billion) of the total spending. Increasing acute care visits were associated with increasing total annualized spending in adjusted analyses (P < 0.001). This association was disproportionately observed in older age groups and children without chronic medical conditions. Conclusions Medicaid spending for children increases with increasing acute care use; this trend was disproportionately observed in older age groups and children without chronic medical conditions. Improved understanding of factors contributing to frequent acute care utilization and disproportionate spending is needed to potentially reduce unnecessary health care costs in these pediatric populations.', 'Background This paper aims to assess the barriers and solutions to the delivery of eye care in primary care settings and solutions to improve the use of comprehensive eye care among Indigenous Australians. Design, setting, participants Qualitative, mixed method study participants include Aboriginal community members, and health and eye care providers in urban, rural and remote settings. Main outcome measures Present evidence for health care providers to better understand and address some of the barriers that limit access to eye care in primary care settings. Results Patient perspectives on barriers to accessing eye care and reasons they choose to seek care or not are presented. Health system barriers identified by health and eye care providers are also presented. Additionally, key enablers for improving access to eye care through primary care services are identified. Conclusion Primary health care services have an important role in Indigenous eye health. There is a critical role for primary care in the coordination of the patient journey and cooperating with other services to improve access to comprehensive eye care. Through improved provision of primary eye care, monitoring of Indigenous eye health indicators and supporting patients to access eye care, it is possible to close the gap for vision.', \"Background To assess the quality of child health services in primary health care (PHC) facilities in Calabar, south-east Nigeria. Design Cross-sectional, descriptive design. Methods Key informant interviews, structured observation, self-administered questionnaire and focus group discussion. Setting Calabar, south-east Nigeria. Participants All 10 PHC facilities in Calabar, 252 PHC workers serving in the facilities, and 76 mothers whose children received care in the facilities. Outcome measures Adequacy of structure (equipment and personnel); process (diagnosis, training and knowledge, use of national case-management algorithm, and supervision), and output (clients' satisfaction). Main results PHC facilities were adequately equipped to the extent of providing immunization services and management of diarrhoea but not for other aspects of care expected of a PHC centre, including management of acute respiratory infections (ARI), a common problem in children in the region. Supply of essential drugs was inadequate in all centres and facilities for emergency care were lacking. Many of the health care workers (68.3%) had adequate training in immunization, and their knowledge scores on immunization issues (62%) was higher than in other aspect of PHC. Use of the national case management algorithm was low among PHC workers. Results of the focus group discussions with mothers showed that a few perceived quality of care to be poor. The main concerns were long waiting time, lack of essential drugs, and attitude of the health workers. Conclusions Inadequacy in the quality of child health services in PHC facilities is a product of failures in a range of quality measures - structural (lack of equipment and essential drugs), process failings (non-use of the national case management algorithm and lack of a protocol of systematic supervision of health workers). Efforts to improve the quality of child health services provided by PHC workers in the study setting and similar locales in less developed countries should focus not only on resource-intensive structural improvements, but also on cheap, cost-effective measures that address actual delivery of services (process), especially the proper use of national guidelines for case management, and meaningful supervision.\", 'Background: Care home residents in England have variable access to health care services. There is currently no coherent policy or consensus about the best arrangements to meet these needs. The purpose of this review was to explore the evidence for how different service delivery models for care home residents support and/or improve wellbeing and health-related outcomes in older people living and dying in care homes. Methods: We conceptualised models of health care provision to care homes as complex interventions. We used a realist review approach to develop a preliminary understanding of what supported good health care provision to care homes. We completed a scoping of the literature and interviewed National Health Service and Local Authority commissioners, providers of services to care homes, representatives from the Regulator, care home managers, residents and their families. We used these data to develop theoretical propositions to be tested in the literature to explain why an intervention may be effective in some situations and not others. We searched electronic databases and related grey literature. Finally the findings were reviewed with an external advisory group. Results: Strategies that support and sustain relational working between care home staff and visiting health care professionals explained the observed differences in how health care interventions were accepted and embedded into care home practice. Actions that encouraged visiting health care professionals and care home staff jointly to identify, plan and implement care home appropriate protocols for care, when supported by ongoing facilitation from visiting clinicians, were important. Contextual factors such as financial incentives or sanctions, agreed protocols, clinical expertise and structured approaches to assessment and care planning could support relational working to occur, but of themselves appeared insufficient to achieve change. Conclusion: How relational working is structured between health and care home staff is key to whether health service interventions achieve health related outcomes for residents and their respective organisations. The belief that either paying clinicians to do more in care homes and/or investing in training of care home staff is sufficient for better outcomes was not supported.', \"Background: Equity in health care across all social groups is a major goal in health care policy. Immigrants may experience more mental health problems than natives, but we do not know the extent to which they seek help from primary health care services. This study aimed to determine a) the rate immigrants use primary health care services for mental health problems compared with Norwegians and b) the association between length of stay, reason for immigration and service use among immigrants. Methods: National register data covering all residents in Norway and all consultations with primary health care services were used. We conducted logistic regression analyses to compare Norwegians' with Polish, Swedish, German, Pakistani and Iraqi immigrants' odds of having had a consultation for a mental health problem (P-consultation). Results: After accounting for background variables, all immigrants groups, except Iraqi men had lower odds of a P-consultation than their Norwegian counterparts. A shorter length of stay was associated with lower odds of a P-consultation. Conclusions: Service use varies by country of origin and patterns are different for men and women. There was some evidence of a possible 'healthy migrant worker' effect among the European groups. Together with previous research, our findings however, suggest that Iraqi women and Pakistanis in particular, may experience barriers in accessing care for mental health problems.\", 'Background: The sustainability of health and social care has led to an imperative to shift the balance of care to communities and support person-centered, integrated, preventive, comanaged, and sustainable care. The digital tool set can support this shift; however, it must extend beyond a clinical focus to include broader personal, social, and environmental needs, experiences, and outcomes. The existing digital health and care design and user requirements literature focuses mainly on specific digital products or design methods. There is little whole-system or whole-of-life consideration, which is crucial to enacting more significant transformations that span different groups and domains. Objective: This study aimed to present a set of recurring user requirements and themes for comanaged digital health and care services derived from the body of co-design projects within a digital health and care program. This study aimed to enable people and organizations looking to reorient their approach to health and care research and delivery from a system-led and condition-specific approach to a more person-centric, whole-of-life model. Methods: Participatory design formed the core methodological approach in underlying the design research, from which user requirements were derived. The process of surfacing requirements involved a selection framework for the identification of eligible projects and a structured review process to consolidate user requirements. Results: This paper presents a set of 14 common user requirements that resulted from a review of co-design projects. The findings demonstrate overlapping and reinforcing sets of needs from citizens and care professionals related to how data are comanaged to improve care and outcomes. This paper discusses the alignment, contrasts, and gaps with broader, comparable literature. It highlights consensus around requirements for personal health storytelling, sharing data on care experiences and how this can support personalized guidance, visualize trends to support decision-making, and generally improve dialog between a citizen and care professionals. These findings identify gaps around how groups and networks of people engage, posing difficult questions for people designing support services as some of the user requirements are not easily met by organizations operating in silos. Conclusions: This study proposes future recommendations for citizens as active, informed, and consenting partners using new forms of privacy-preserving digital infrastructure that puts the citizen in firm control. It is also recommended that these findings be used by people developing new digital services to ensure that they can start with knowledge of the broader user requirement context. This should inform domain-specific research and development questions and processes. Further work is needed to extend these common requirements to more explicitly consider the trust framework required when citizens comanage their data and care across a broad range of formal and informal actors. Consideration of how authority, delegation, and trust function between members of the public will be critical.', \"Background The digital transformation of healthcare enables new ways of working in cancer care directing attention on the digital skills of healthcare professionals. This systematic review aims to identify existing evidence about digital skills among health care professionals in cancer care to identify the needs for future education and research.Methods Database searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and ERIC to identify studies until March 2023. The inclusion criteria were digital skills of health care professionals in cancer care as described by themselves, other health care professionals, patients or significant others. The CASP tool was used for quality assessment of the studies. Data was analysed following inductive content analysis.Results The search produced 4563 records, of which 24 studies were included (12 qualitative, 10 quantitative, 1 mixed methods design and 1 strategy paper). Four main categories were identified describing HCPs' required skills, existing skills and development areas of digital skills in cancer care: Skills for information technology, Skills for ethical practice, Skills for creating a human-oriented relationship and Skills for digital education and support. In development areas, one more main category, Skills for implementing digital health, was identified.Conclusion The digital skills of health care professionals in cancer care are multifaceted and fundamental for quality cancer care. The skills need to be assessed to provide education based on actual learning needs. The review findings can be used for education and research in this field.\", 'Objective: We sought to examine the extent to which reported barriers to health care services differ between American Indians (AIs) and non-Hispanic Whites (Whites). Methods: A statewide stratified random sample of Minnesota health care program enrollees was surveyed. Responses from AI and White adult enrollees (n = 1281) and parents of child enrollees (n = 572) were analyzed using logistic regression models that account for the complex sample design. Barriers examined include: financial, access, and cultural barriers, confidence/trust in providers, and discrimination. Results: Both AIs and Whites report barriers to health care access. However, a greater proportion of AIs report barriers in most categories. Among adults, AIs are more likely to report racial discrimination, cultural misunderstandings, family/work responsibilities, and transportation difficulties, whereas Whites are more likely to report being unable to see their preferred doctor. A higher proportion of adult enrollees compared with parents of child enrollees report barriers in most categories; however, differences between parents of AIs and White children are more substantial. In addition to racial discrimination and cultural misunderstandings, parents of AI children are more likely than parents of White enrollees to report limited clinic hours, lack of Conclusions: Although individuals have enrolled in health care programs and have access to care, barriers to using these services remain. Significant differences between AIs and Whites involve issues of trust, respect, and discrimination. Providers must address barriers experienced by AIs to improve accessibility, acceptability, and quality of care for AI health care consumers.', \"Children with medical complexity have ongoing health needs that may require dependence on medical technologies. While hospital admissions are an important focus of care delivery for these children, a majority of the time they are cared for in their own homes. Parents' report feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the scope of their responsibilities, but they become sophisticated care providers and assume greater authority when providing their children's care at home. Communication, decision-making, and dealing with conflict with members of health care teams have been central concerns in parents' reports of their home health care experiences. The objective is to review literature on relational aspects of parent and home health care provider care practices for children with medical complexity receiving home health care services. A narrative review was conducted. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, PsychINFO, ERIC, and CINAHL databases for English language studies published since database inception was carried out. Eligible studies focused on relational aspects of parent and home health care provider care practices for children with medical complexity receiving home health care services. Nine empirical studies were selected for this review. Literature describes parents' and providers' experiences managing a child with medical complexity in the home and the effects for the family and the parent-health care provider relationship. Parents want to be actively involved in all aspects of care that affects their child and ultimately their family. Further investigation is needed to better understand relational aspects of parenthome health care provider care practices to support child/family health and well-being in the home setting.\", \"Background: Health care is provided under the conditions in which people live and under the rules and regulations of a prevailing health system. As a consequence, 'local' circumstances are an important determinant of the actual care that can be provided and its effects on the health of individuals and populations. This plays in particular, but not exclusively, a role in community - based primary health care. Although this is generally accepted, there is little insight in the impact of the setting and context inwhich health care is provided on the outcome of care. Aim: This paper argues the case to use this natural variation within and between countries as an opportunity to be used as a form of natural experiment in health research. Arguments: We argue that analysing and comparing outcomes across settings, that is comparative outcomes of interventions that have been performed under different health care conditions will improve the understanding of how the real - life setting in which health care is provided - including the health system, the socio - economic circumstances and prevailing cultural values - do determine outcome of care. Recommendations: To facilitate comparison of research findings across health systems and different socio - economic and cultural contexts, we recommend a more detailed reporting of the conditions and circumstances under which health research has been performed. A set of core variables is proposed for studies in primary health care.\", 'We summarize recent data on health and health care in the United States. Many millions suffer financial distress due to medical bills and forego needed care because of costs. Pay-for-performance programs have failed to achieve the results promised and in some cases have backfired. Health care firms expend huge amounts on marketing that provides no benefit to patients. Millions of health care workers, particularly women of color, are so poorly paid that they live in poverty, and gender-based pay inequities remain common in the health sector. Polls continue to show strong popular support for a single-payer reform, but politicians continue to resist it.', 'Objectives: This article outlines the budgetary setting within the UK health-care system. Methods: it is argued that while prospective budgets can give rise to efficient resource allocation outcomes, this relies on the budget being set at an appropriate level and the accompanying incentive structures being efficient. The organizational structures and the interrelationships are critical. The recent history of UK National Health Service reforms and expenditure is outlined. It is suggested that until recently, although the budget system has the potential to promote efficiency, the aggregate budget allocated to the NHS has probably been too low given public expectations, technology advances, and preferences for health care. Results: The aggregate budget is due to rise considerably over the next 5 years. While some incentive and regulatory provisions will move the budget toward an efficient allocation many microlevel incentive issues remain. Conclusion: Whether efficient patterns of health-care allocation emerge remains open to debate, however, because the existing incentive mechanisms are not optimal.', \"Objective To evaluate the impact of Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO) on health care access for adults with disabilities (AWDs). Data Sources Mandatory and voluntary enrollment data for AWDs in Medicaid MCOs in each county were merged with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Area Resource File for 1996-2004. Study Design I use logit regression and two evaluation perspectives to compare access and preventive care for AWDs in Medicaid MCOs with FFS. From the state's perspective, I compare AWDs in counties with mandatory, voluntary, and no MCOs. From the enrollee's perspective, I compare AWDs who must enroll in an MCO or FFS to those who may choose between them. Principal Findings Mandatory MCO enrollees are 24.9 percent more likely to wait > 30 minutes to see a provider, 32 percent more likely to report a problem accessing a specialist, and 10 percent less likely to receive a flu shot within the past year. These differences persist from the state evaluation perspective. Conclusions States should not expect a dramatic change in health care access when they implement Medicaid MCOs to deliver care to the adult disabled population. However, continued attention to specialty care access is warranted for mandatory MCO enrollees.\", \"Background: The effectiveness of a collaborative model of mental health treatment under conditions of routine care in a primary care setting has received limited evaluation. Potential effects include reduced symptoms and decreased healthcare utilization. Methods: The present study describes treatment outcome for 234 patients seen by a mental health professional in a primary care clinic using a collaborative model of care. Patients were seen for one session (n = 120), two sessions (n = 59), three sessions (n = 29), or four or more sessions (n = 26). Patients completed the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) at every session. Results: OQ-45 total scores for patients seen for more than one appointment showed statistically significant reductions in psychological distress from first to last session for all groups. Pre-treatment health care utilization was unrelated to level of psychological distress at the first session. A comparison of health care utilization for the six month period before and after the first session showed a small but statistically significant increase in total number of medical visits. Conclusions: The results support the effectiveness of a collaborative model of mental health care for reducing symptoms in patients seen in a primary care setting. Patient's overall healthcare utilization in the short term was largely unaffected.\", 'Rationale, aims, and objectives The health care delivery model in the United States does not work; it perpetuates unequal access to care, favours treatment over prevention, and contributes to persistent health disparities and lack of insurance. The vast majority of those who suffer from preventable diseases and health disparities, and who are at greatest risk of not having insurance, are low-income minorities (Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-Americans) who live in high risk and vulnerable communities. The historical lack of support in the United States for Universal Health Care (UHC) and Primary Health Care (PHC)-with their emphasis on health care for all, population health, and social determinants of health-requires community health scientists to develop innovative local solutions for addressing unmet community health needs. Methods We developed a model community health science approach for improving health in fragile communities, by combining community-oriented primary care (COPC), community-based participatory research (CBPR), asset-based community development, and service learning principles. During the past two decades, our team has collaborated with community residents, local leaders, and many different types of organizations, to address the health needs of vulnerable patients. The approach defines health as a social outcome, resulting from a combination of clinical science, collective responsibility, and informed social action. Results From 2000 to 2020, we established a federally funded research programme for testing interventions to improve health outcomes in vulnerable communities, by working in partnership with community organizations and other stakeholders. The partnership goals were reducing chronic disease risk and multimorbidity, by stimulating lifestyle changes, increasing healthy behaviours and health knowledge, improving care seeking and patient self-management, and addressing the social determinants of health and population health. Our programmes have also provided structured community health science training in high-risk communities for hundreds of doctors in training. Conclusion Our community health science approach demonstrates that the factors contributing to health can only be addressed by working directly with and in affected communities to co-develop health care solutions across the broad range of causal factors. As the United States begins to consider expanding health care options consistent with PHC and UHC principles, our community health science experience provides useful lessons in how to engage communities to address the deficits of the current system. Perhaps the greatest assets US health care systems have for better addressing population health and the social determinants of health are the important health-related initiatives already underway in most local communities. Building partnerships based on local resources and ongoing social determinants of health initiatives is the key for medicine to meaningfully engage communities for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities. This has been the greatest lesson we have learned the past two decades, has provided the foundation for our community health science approach, and accounts for whatever success we have achieved.', \"The health care system constitutes the organisational framework in which health care delivery takes place. The system and its reforms, therefore, have to reckon with the typical aspects of care delivery and medical practice. Medicine is not the application of medical scientific knowledge but can better be understood as a 'professional practice'. `Practice' is understood as a complex and coherent form of socially established cooperative human activity directed at the realisation of the destination inherent to that practice. The destination of medical practice is to provide adequate medical carl to a person in need because of health problems. This means that medical practice is ethically qualified. The destination of medical practice can be realised by competent performance of the practice, which means that the rules that constitute, i.e. define and limit, that practice are observed. These rules are predominantly of a 'knowing how' kind (tacit knowledge). Health care systems and health care reforms should respect this character of medical practice. The way in which health care expenses are financed, in other words, the health insurance system, forms part of the health care system and can only be evaluated in the latter's context. In order to define positive and negative aspects of health care systems and insurance systems we describe three ideal- type health care systems, the guild-free-choice system, the centrally planned health service and managed competition. Existing systems can be understood as one of these systems, often with elements of the other(s). The combination of this systems analysis and our normative view of medical practice provides us with normative guidelines for the organisation of health care and for the function of health insurance as part of it.\", \"The aim of this paper was to implement and evaluate health promoting palliative care projects through partnerships formed within local communities in the Hume Region, Victoria, Australia. Health promoting palliative care is a public health approach to palliative care developed by Kellehear (1999). This article reports on a project in which the Hume Regional Palliative Care Service in Victoria, Australia sought to implement the approach through partnerships formed with a range of community groups and service agencies in their region. Funding was provided over a two-year period by the 'Caring Communities Program' of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. It was hoped that the project overall would increase community capacity to participate in the care of members of the community living with dying and loss. The project developed implementation strategies and health promotion project guidelines, as outlined below. During the two-year period the palliative care service entered in a number Of new partnerships with community groups and other health services. At first much of the initiative in forming these partnerships came from the palliative care service, but as the project progressed the initiative came increasingly from community partners.\", 'Health care transitions (HCT) from pediatric to adult health care remain a challenge for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), their families and their clinicians. While the HCT literature has expanded, gaps remain in how to improve health outcomes during transitions. HCTs broadly encompass three key domain areas: transition planning, transfer to adult health care clinicians or an adult model of care, and integration into an adult care/model of care. The CYSHCNet national research agenda development process, described in a previous article, prioritized several key research areas to address deficiencies in the HCT process. The highest priority questions identified were What are the best models to accomplish youth-adult transition planning? How might this translate to other transitions (eg, to new clinicians, new settings, new schools, etc.)? and How do gaps in insurance and community supports during early adulthood effect CYSHCN health outcomes, and how can they be reduced?. Based upon these priorities, we describe the current state of transition research and recommendations for future investigation. Recommendations: The authors recommend 3 primary areas of investigation: 1) Understanding the optimal development and implementation of HCT service models in partnership with youth and families to improve transition readiness and transfer 2) Defining the process and outcome measures that capture adequacy of transition-related activities and 3) Evaluating fiscal policies that incentivize the processes of transition readiness development, transfer to adult health care services, and continuity of care within an adult health care setting. This article explores approaches within each research domain.', \"BackgroundIn January 2010, the choice reform was instituted in Swedish primary health care establishing free entry for private primary health care providers and enabling patients to choose freely among primary health care centers. The motivation behind the reform was to improve access to primary care and responsiveness to patient expectations. Reform effects on health care utilization have previously been investigated by using subgroup analyses assuming a pattern of homogeneous subgroups of the population. By using a different methodological approach, the aim of this study was to, from an equity perspective, investigate long term trends of primary health care utilization following the choice reform.MethodA closed cohort was created based on register data from Region Skane, the third most populated region in Sweden, describing individuals' health care utilization between 2007-2017. Using a novel approach, utilization data, measured as primary health care visits, was matched with socioeconomic and geographic determinants, and analyzed using logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 659,298 individuals were included in the cohort. Sex differences in utilization were recorded to decrease in the older age group and to increase in the younger age group. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing utilization in older men to be associated with higher socioeconomic position, while in women it was associated with lower socioeconomic position. Furthermore, groups of becoming high utilizers were all associated with lower socioeconomic position and with residence in urban areas.ConclusionThe impact of demographic, socioeconomic and geographic determinants on primary health care utilization varies in magnitude and direction between groups of the population. As a result, the increase in utilization as observed in the general population following the choice reform is unevenly distributed between different population groups.\", \"In cancer care, communication and coordination across the cancer continuum is paramount for delivering effective, high-quality, patient-centered care. However, achieving optimally coordinated cancer care is inherently challenging, especially in the case of Veterans Administration (VA) care for women's reproductive health cancers. Given the relatively small number of women Veterans requiring care for reproductive malignancies, VA often must rely on community providers to deliver this care, necessitating coordination across two or more health care systems. Recently, VA has invested heavily in improving care for women Veterans through several initiatives and efforts. This article reviews VA's successes, challenges, and future opportunities in research and innovation in the context of care coordination across the cancer continuum (i.e., prevention and screening, diagnosis and treatment, survivorship care, palliative and supportive care) for women Veterans with reproductive health malignancies. We describe how coordination of VA care for reproductive health malignancies currently reflects a mix of successes that demonstrate use of strong evidenced-based practices and challenges, with solutions yet to be fully developed and implemented. We conclude that there are a multitude of opportunities for future research, interventions, and potential avenues for implementing innovative approaches to coordinate VA reproductive cancer care across the cancer continuum.\", 'Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death and important driver of health care costs. Recent German health care reforms have promoted integrated care contracts allowing statutory health insurance providers more room to organize health care provision. One,provider offers KardioPro, an integrated primary care-based CHD prevention program. As insurance providers should be aware of the financial consequences when developing optional programs, this study aims to analyze the costs associated with KardioPro participation. 13,264 KardioPro participants were compared with a propensity score-matched control group. Post-enrollment health care costs were calculated based on routine data over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. For those people who incurred costs, KardioPro participation was significantly associated with increased physician costs (by 33%), reduced hospital costs (by 19%), and reduced pharmaceutical costs (by 16%). Overall costs were increased by 4%, but this was not significant. Total excess costs per observation year were (sic)131 per person (95% confidence interval: [(sic)-36.5; (sic)296]). Overall, KardioPro likely affected treatment as the program increased costs of physician services and reduced costs of hospital services. Further effects of substituting potential inpatient care with increased outpatient care might become fully apparent only over a longer time horizon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The two concepts developed quite differently however. The concept of self care did not attain the same level of legitimacy and stability as health promotion, which has evolved from an alternative approach to the dominance of traditional disease prevention into a rapidly developing health field. The emergence of the concept of self care and the reasons for its relative lack of acceptance are discussed. It is concluded that the concept of self care is logically allied with the field of health promotion and serves an important function in optimizing health related behavior.', 'China has gone through a comprehensive health care insurance reform since 2003 and achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011. The new health care insurance system provides China with a huge opportunity for the development of health care and medical research when its rich medical resources are fully unfolded. In this study, we review the Chinese health care system and its implication for medical research, especially within clinical epidemiology. First, we briefly review the population register system, the distribution of the urban and rural population in China, and the development of the Chinese health care system after 1949. In the following sections, we describe the current Chinese health care delivery system and the current health insurance system. We then focus on the construction of the Chinese health information system as well as several existing registers and research projects on health data. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of the health care system in regard to clinical epidemiology research. China now has three main insurance schemes. The Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) covers urban employees and retired employees. The Urban Residence Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) covers urban residents, including children, students, elderly people without previous employment, and unemployed people. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) covers rural residents. The Chinese Government has made efforts to build up health information data, including electronic medical records. The establishment of universal health care insurance with linkage to medical records will provide potentially huge research opportunities in the future. However, constructing a complete register system at a nationwide level is challenging. In the future, China will demand increased capacity of researchers and data managers, in particular within clinical epidemiology, to explore the rich resources.', \"Aim To describe parental perceptions of general health, oral health and received dental health care in Swedish children with Down syndrome (DS). Methods Online questionnaire, quantitative data analysis (Chi-square test). Results Parents of 101 children with DS (52 boys, 49 girls, mean age: 9.6 years) participated. Seventy percent rated their child's general health and 74% their child's oral health as good or very good. Parents, who rated their child's oral health as poor (8%), also reported that dental procedures were difficult. Children received dental care at general (55%) and specialist clinics (53%). Ninety-four percent of parents of children receiving specialist dental health care were satisfied compared to 70% of parents with children in general clinics. The parents most valued characteristics of dental professionals were patience (63%) and their ability to engage the child (68%). Parents wanted multidisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion Most parents rated their child's general and oral health as good or very good. Children with poor oral health were also reported to have difficulties coping with dental procedures. Parents wanted dental care to be tailored to meet their child's unique needs. They wanted dental professionals to have knowledge about children with a need for special care. Lastly, they requested multidisciplinary collaboration.\", \"Progress to address health care equity requires health care providers' commitment, but their engagement may depend on their perceptions of the factors contributing to inequity. To understand providers' perceptions of causes of racial health care disparities, a short survey was delivered to health care providers who work at 3 Veterans Health Administration sites, followed by qualitative interviews (N = 53). Survey data indicated that providers attributed the causes of disparities to social and economic conditions more than to patients' or providers' behaviors. Qualitative analysis revealed differences in the meaning that participants ascribed to these causal factors. Participants who believed providers contribute to disparities discussed race and racism more readily, identified the mechanisms through which disparities emerge, and contextualized patient-level factors more than those who believed providers contributed less to disparities. Differences in provider understanding of the underlying causal factors suggest a multidimensional approach to engage providers in health equity efforts.\", \"Over the last decade, health literacy has become a vibrant area of research. Our objective was to evaluate health literacy and its association with socio-demographic variables, self-perception of health and the presence of chronic conditions in primary health-care patients. A cross-sectional study among 120 patients was conducted in two primary health-care centers. The test of functional health literacy in adults, a 50-item reading comprehension and 17-item numerical ability test (score, 0-100) were administered. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were applied. Inadequate and marginal health literacy existed in 43 participants (41.0%), and adequate health literacy was present in 62 participants (59.0%). Functional health literacy was significantly different by location, gender, age, marital status, employment, education, material status, self-perception of health and presence of chronic conditions. Based on the multivariate analysis, health literacy was significantly associated with the participant's age (odds ratio [OR], 4.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.41-9.80; P = 0.000), level of education (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.73-11.57; P = 0.002) and chronic conditions (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.16-3.11; P = 0.010). These results provide evidence that limitations in functional health literacy are widespread among primary health-care patients and encourage efforts for further monitoring. Low health literacy may impair a patient's understanding of health messages and limit their ability to attend to their medical problems.\", 'Health care reform has become a global phenomenon. Countries are experiencing similar problems with their health care systems and are reaching for similar solutions. Management is seen as crucial in many countries as the principal means of securing supply-side reforms. Many of these centre on establishing a new relationship between professionals, notably the medical profession, and the state. The aim has been to exercise greater influence over how professionals practice and use resources. The application of new public management principles based on industrial sector practices and concepts of management has created tensions within professional groups who feel themselves, and their craft, to be under attack. But the new managerialism has to be seen within a context of rapid social and economic change. It is not possible to predict what the impact of such change is likely to be on health services in the future or on those who provide them. The paper offers an overview of health care reforms and assesses how it is shaping, or re-shaping, the roles and tasks of health care personnel. One conclusion is the mismatch between the management style favoured by policy-makers and reformers and the necessary flexibility required in skill mix and organization of work. High-trust relations lie at the heart of professional forms of organisation whereas the new managerialism appears to be based on the expectation of low-trust relations. The paper concludes with a brief look at the implications of all these developments for training and education and finds that there is still a long way to go before there is any real prospect of providing and equipping health care personnel with the requisite skills to enable them to meet the complex challenges that are a common characteristic of health care systems.

The program was designed with the belief that dedicated team member time, senior leadership engagement, deliberate project/team selection, and robust, tailored project support would enable rapid and transformative health care redesign. Three teams were supported in the initial 1-year funding cycle; all 3 teams successfully designed, implemented, and tested new care models for different serious illness populations. Results demonstrated improved satisfaction, decreased length of stay, and a positive return on investment. Critical evaluation of current structures and processes will help identify refined strategies to support diverse teams that will challenge the norms of health care delivery and explore novel partnerships, approaches, and settings for care delivery.

They cannot communicate by spoken language and need around the clock support. The health care for people with PIMD is typically provided by a number of different health care services in collaboration with residential care staff and their managers. The quality of health care for people with PIMD are important due to their limited ability to communicate their needs. The aim of this study was to explore residential care staff and manager's experiences and views of health care services for adults with PIMD. Methods Thirteen semi-structured interviews with residential care staff (n = 7) and managers (n = 6) were conducted and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results The informants expressed a variety of experiences, under the theme was Quality of health care is enhanced through residential care staff. The theme was comprised of four subthemes: (1) Individually tailored support promotes quality, (2) Accessibility requires adaptation and prioritization by healthcare providers, (3) Disability competence promotes quality and safety and (4) Complex collaboration conditions between the person with PIMD, residential care staff and disability health care. Conclusions The residential care staff create quality of care in their role as representatives for adults with PIMD. The care situation is complex and requires adequate competence in the disability, the individual's needs and adaptations to ensure quality of health care. It is also important to build collaboration with other services that are involved in the care of people with PIMD.\", \"As the health care system moves in a new direction, toward managed care, the critical role of public health in society's efforts to mitigate illness and the realization of health become more apparent. Indeed, the public health problems of this era will not yield to simple solutions. They require a multitude of resources, both human and material, and a myriad of services derived from these resources. Public health's role is to serve as the government's presence in assessing health status, developing policy, evaluating the effectiveness of policy implementation, and assuring access to and quality of comprehensive health services. Increasingly, public health must coordinate a wide array of systems in both the private and public sectors to fulfill its purpose.\", \"Background: While research on individual health literacy is steadily increasing, less attention has been paid to the context of care that may help to increase the patient's ability to navigate health care or to compensate for their limited health literacy. In 2012, Brach et al. introduced the concept of health literate health care organizations (HLHOs) to describe the organizational context of care. This paper presents our effort in developing and validating an HLHO instrument. Method: Ten items were developed to represent the ten attributes of HLHO (HLHO-10) based on a literature review, an expert workshop, a focus group discussion, and qualitative interviews. The instrument was applied in a key informant survey in 51 German hospitals as part of a larger study on patient information and training needs (PIAT-study). Item properties were analyzed and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the instrument's unidimensionality. To investigate the instrument's predictive validity, a multilevel analysis was performed that used the HLHO-10 score to predict the adequacy of information provided to 1,224 newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients treated at the sample hospitals. Results: Cronbach's a of the resulting scale was 0.89. CFA verified the one-factor structure after allowing for the correlation for four pairs of error terms. In the multilevel model, HLHO-10 significantly predicted the adequacy of information as perceived by patients. Conclusion: The instrument has satisfactory reliability and validity. It provides a useful tool to assess the degree to which health care organizations help patients to navigate, understand, and use information and services. Further validation should include participant observation in health care organizations and a sample that is not limited to breast cancer care.\", \"Health care organizations increasingly recognize the impact of social needs on health outcomes. As organizations develop and scale efforts to address social needs, little is known about the optimal role for clinicians in providing social care. In this study, the authors aimed to understand how health care organizations involve clinicians in formal social care efforts. In 2019, the authors conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with administrators at 29 health care organizations. Interviews focused on the development and implementation of formal social care programs within the health care organization and the role of clinicians within those programs. A few administrators described formal roles for primary care clinicians in organizational efforts to deliver social care. Administrators frequently described programs that were deliberately structured to shield clinicians (eg, clinicians were not expected to review social risk screening results or be involved in addressing social needs). The authors identified 4 ways that administrators felt clinicians could meaningfully engage in social care programs: (1) discuss social risks to strengthen relationships with patients; (2) adjust clinical care follow-up plans based on social risks; (3) modify prescriptions based on social risks; and (4) refer patients to other care team members who can directly assist with social risks. Administrators were hesitant to increase primary care clinicians' responsibilities by tasking them with social care activities. Defining appropriate and scalable roles for clinicians along with adequate support from other care team members may increase the effectiveness of social care programs.\", 'Primary health care in Australia has undergone 2 decades of change. Starting with a vision for a national health strategy with general practice at its core, Australia established local meso-level primary health care organizations-Divisions of General Practice-moving from focus on individual practitioners to a professional collective local voice. The article identifies how these meso-level organizations have helped the Australian primary health care system evolve by supporting the roll-out of initiatives including national practice accreditation, a focus on quality improvement, expansion of multidisciplinary teams into general practice, regional integration, information technology adoption, and improved access to care. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to ensuring equitable access and the supply and distribution of a primary care workforce, addressing the increasing rates of chronic disease and obesity, and overcoming the fragmentation of funding and accountability in the Australian system.

Despite major advances in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer, health care ministries face multitiered challenges to create and support health care programs that can improve breast cancer outcomes. In addition to the financial and organizational problems inherent in any health care system, breast health programs are hindered by a lack of recognition of cancer as a public health priority, trained health care personnel shortages and migration, public and health care provider educational deficits, and social barriers that impede patient entry into early detection and cancer treatment programs. No perfect health care system exists, even in the wealthiest countries. Based on inevitable economic and practical constraints, all health care systems are compelled to make trade-offs among four factors: access to care, scope of service, quality of care, and cost containment. Given these trade-offs, guidelines can define stratified approaches by which economically realistic incremental improvements can be sequentially implemented within the context of resource constraints to improve breast health care. Disease-specific vertical programs warrant horizontal integration with existing health care systems in limited-resource countries. The Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) Health Care Systems and Public Policy Panel defined a stratified framework outlining recommended breast health care interventions for each of four incremental levels of resources (basic, limited, enhanced, and maximal). Reallocation of existing resources and integration of a breast health care program with existing programs and infrastructure can potentially improve outcomes in a cost-sensitive manner. This adaptable framework can be used as a tool by policymakers for program planning and research design to make best use of available resources to improve breast health care in a given limited resource setting.', 'This paper presents a detailed description of health care resource utilisation and costs of a pilot interdisciplinary health care model of palliative home care in Ontario, Canada. The descriptive evaluation entailed examining the use of services and costs of the pilot program: patient demographics, length of stay broken down by disposition (discharged, alive, death), access to services/resources, use of family physician and specialist services, and drug use. There were 434 patients included in the pilot program. Total costs were approximately CAN$2.4 million, and the cost per person amounted to approximately CAN$5586.33 with average length of stay equal to over 2 months (64.22 days). One may assume that length of stay would be influenced by the amount of service and support available. Future research might investigate whether in-home palliative home care is the most cost effective and suitable care setting for those patients requiring home care services for expected periods of time.

The authors examined the relationship between receipt of routine medical care and receipt of dental care among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who resided in the American Dental Association's Fifth Trustee District, which includes Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Methods. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2001 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a module of that year's State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Maternal and-Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Service Administration, Rockville, Md., and conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta). The authors used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to explore the relationships (n = 2,092) between predisposing, enabling and need factors and receipt of dental care. Results. The parents of an estimated 76 percent of CSHCN in the district reported that their child had a need-for dental care in the previous 12 months. Of these, 13.1 percent did not receive care. Failure to obtain needed dental care was associated with failure to obtain routine medical care, as was having a lower income. Conclusions. Failure to obtain routine medical care may be a risk factor for failure to obtain dental care. Any income below 400 percent of the federal poverty guidelines appears to be a barrier to receiving dental care for CSHCN. Practice Implications: Providers of routine medical care may play an important role in linking CSHCN to dental care. Investigators need to examine other barriers to dental care for CSHCN. Strategies to optimize access to dental care for CSHCN at all income levels are needed.\", 'The relationship between health care expenditure and health outcomes has been the subject of recent academic inquiry in order to inform cost-effectiveness thresholds for health technology assessment agencies. Previous studies in public health systems have relied upon data aggregated at the national or regional level; however, there remains debate about whether the supply side effect of changes to expenditure are identifiable using data at this level of aggregation. We use detailed patient data derived from electronic neonatal records across England along with routinely available cost data to estimate the effect of changes to patient expenditure on clinical health outcomes in a well-defined patient population. A panel of 32 neonatal intensive care units for the period 2009-2013 was constructed. Accounting for the potential endogeneity of expenditure a 100 pound increase in the cost per intensive care cot day (sample average cost: 1,127) pound is estimated to reduce the risk of mortality of 0.38 percentage points (sample average mortality: 11.0%) in neonatal intensive care. This translates into a cost per life saved in neonatal intensive care of approximately 420,000 pound.', \"Background Trans and gender-diverse people face multiple barriers within health care. Primary care practitioners are key to providing health care to trans and gender-diverse people but they often lack training in, and understanding of, trans identities and healthcare options. Few studies have examined health professionals' understanding of the barriers that exist in health care for trans and gender-diverse people. Aim To map out barriers to providing good-quality health care to trans and gender-diverse people, and explore ways to address them. Design and setting A qualitative interview study involving 20 health professionals working with young trans and gender-diverse people. Method Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were generated using semi-structured qualitative interviews. A thematic analysis involved coding and categorising data using NVivo (version 12) software and further conceptual analysis in which developing themes were identified. Results Four barrier domains to good-quality care for trans and gender-diverse people were identified: structural (related to lack of guidelines, long waiting times, and shortage of specialist centres); educational (based on lack of training on trans health); cultural and social (reflecting negative attitudes towards trans people); and technical (related to information systems and technology). Conclusion There is an urgent need to address the barriers trans and gender-diverse people face in health care. Structural-level solutions include health policy, professional education, and standards; at the practice level, GPs can act as potential drivers of change in addressing the cultural and technical barriers to better meet the needs of their trans and gender-diverse patients.\", 'Objective: To estimate the average incremental health care expenditures associated with habitual long and short duration of sleep as compared with healthy/average sleep duration. Data Source: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2012; N=6476) linked to the 2010-2011 National Health Interview Survey. Study Design: Annual differences in health care expenditures are estimated for habitual long and short duration sleepers as compared with average duration sleepers using 2-part logit generalized linear regression models. Principal Findings: Habitual short duration sleepers reported an additional $1400 in total unadjusted health care expenditures compared to people with average sleep duration (P<0.01). After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and health behavior factors, this difference remained significant with an additional $1278 in total health care expenditures over average duration sleepers (P<0.05). Long duration sleepers reported even higher, $2994 additional health care expenditures over average duration sleepers. This difference in health care expenditures remained significantly high ($1500,P<0.01) in the adjusted model. Expenditure differences are more pronounced for inpatient hospitalization, office expenses, prescription expenses, and home health care expenditures. Conclusions: Habitual short and long sleep duration is associated with higher health care expenditures, which is consistent with the association between unhealthy sleep duration and poorer health outcomes.', 'The objective of this concept analysis was to formulate an operational definition, so that those seeking, providing, and legislating health care policy would share a common interpretation of the concept. A concept analysis following the strategy suggested by Walker and Avant was used to identify antecedents, attributes, and empirical referents of access to health care. Furthermore, model, borderline, contrary, and invented cases were described. A theoretical definition was derived, which will lead to a better understanding of the concept and bring the concept closer to measurability and readiness for an operational definition. Access to health care has been addressed in political campaigns, studied by numerous legislative committees, and purported to be in an emergency state of disrepair. However, a measurable definition of access to health care continues to elude providers and legislators of health care; in as much, the meaning of the concept varies with the user.', 'This article explores legislative provisions in relation to patient privacy in the context of integrated health and social care and the development of multidisciplinary health care teams that include practitioners from private sector and government agencies in the health, education, child protection, family welfare, disability, aged-care, housing, local government and criminal justice sectors. The definition of a multidisciplinary health care team and the extent to which health information can be shared within the team is examined. Australian Commonwealth and State legislation provides for the sharing within a health care team of health information where that is for the primary purpose it was collected, and for a secondary purpose where that is directly related to the primary purpose, or might be reasonably expected by the patient for the provision of their care. For this purpose consent is not required.', 'The authors of ???Integration or Fragmentation of Health Care? Examining Policies and Politics in a Belgian Case Study??? present a fresh perspective on the inertia of integrated care (IC) implementation. They conclude that the decisive power in Belgium is fragmented and undermines efforts towards IC. As researchers in integrated heart failure care and active primary health care professionals, we comment on the three policy initiatives evaluated by Martens et al from a bottom-up perspective. A Learning Health Care Network (LHCN) was established Sept 2019 to overcome fragmentation, the lack of evaluation and capacity loss each time a pilot project ends. This commentary wishes to illustrate that a LHCN can be a powerful meso-level mechanism to engage in alignment work and to overcome macro-level barriers that are often difficult to change and not supportive of IC.', 'Advance care planning and symptom management (supportive cancer care) improves patient experiences and reduces acute care use (hospitalizations and emergency department visits). Strong evidence supports team-based approaches to deliver supportive cancer care. However no studies, to our knowledge, have evaluated the use of lay or community health workers to deliver supportive cancer care as compared to usual cancer care. The Health Care Coach Support intervention was developed to improve cancer care. The intervention assigns a lay or community health worker health coach to all patients newly diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer or patients with recurrent or progressive disease. The intervention aims to educate and activate patients in advance care planning discussions and symptom management with their clinicians. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the 12-month health coach intervention combined with usual oncology care or usual oncology care alone. The primary outcome is to evaluate whether the intervention reduces acute care use measured at 6-months follow-up more than usual care. Secondary outcomes include the effect on acute care, palliative care, and hospice at 12-months follow-up and one month prior to death for patients who die. Additional secondary outcomes include changes in patient satisfaction with decision and patient satisfaction with care from baseline (time of enrollment) to 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-enrollment. The Health Coach Support study addresses an important gap in supportive cancer care by testing whether a team-based approach using non-professional personnel can ensure delivery of these services. Findings can assist in our understanding of how to improve care for patients with cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration #NCT03154190', \"Objectives: Our two study objectives were: (1) to understand the relationship between the perception of a previous negative health-care experience and race/ethnicity, and how socio-demographic, access-to-health-care, and self-reported health variables modified this relationship; and (2) to assess how many behaviors participants reported changing as a result of experiencing a perceived negative health-care experience, which behaviors they changed, and if there were differences in patterns of change across racial/ethnic groups. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 600 African-American, Mexican-Hispanic, and white adults in socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods in Chicago, IL. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the relationship between a perceived negative health-care experience in the last 5 years and race/ethnicity. We summed and then calculated the percentage of people who changed each of the 10 behaviors and evaluated whether or not there were differences in behavior change across racial/ethnic groups. Principal findings: More than 32% of participants reported a perceived negative health-care experience in the past 5 years. Participants who had a bachelor's degree or above (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.01-8.63), avoided needed care due to cost (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11-3.06), or who reported fair/poor health (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.66-7.80) had significantly increased odds of reporting a negative health-care experience. Of these people, 88% reported 'sometimes/always' changing at least one health-seeking behavior. There were no racial/ethnic differences in reporting negative experiences or in patterns of behavior change. Conclusions: Race/ethnicity was not related to reporting a perceived negative health-care experience or reported patterns of behavior change in response to that experience. However, those who avoided care due to cost were more highly educated, or who indicated poorer health status reported having a negative experience more often. Our findings suggest that the perception of a previous negative experience may influence subsequent health-care-seeking behaviors.\", \"BACKGROUND: The influence of prior patterns of health care utilization on future health care utilization has had minimal investigation in populations with musculoskeletal disorders. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between presurgical health care utilization and postsurgical health care utilization in a population of patients undergoing hip surgery in the US Military Health System. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, person-level data were collected for patients undergoing hip arthroscopy in the Military Health System from 2003 to 2015, capturing all encounters 12 months before and 24 months after surgery for every individual. Cluster analysis was used to categorize individuals with high and low health care utilization, based on preoperative health care visits. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson and generalized linear models were generated. Health care utilization outcomes were targeted, including costs, visits, and medication use. RESULTS: There were 1850 individuals in the final cohort (mean age, 32.18 years; 55.4% male). The high health care utilization group averaged 57.69 +/- 25.87 visits, compared to 20.43 +/- 8.36 visits in the low utilization group. There were significant differences between groups for total health care visits (58.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.39, 58.58), total health care costs ($11 539.71; 95% CI: $10 557.26, $12 595.04), hip-related visits (12.77; 95% CI: 12.59, 12.96), hip-related costs ($3325.07; 95% CI: $2886.43, $3804.51), days' supply of pain medications (752.67; 95% CI: 751.24, 754.11), opioid prescriptions (48.83; 95% CI: 48.47, 49.21), and cost of pain medications ($1074.80; 95% CI: $1011.91, $1137.68). CONCLUSION: Presurgical patterns of health care utilization were associated with postsurgical patterns of health care utilization, indicating that those patients who used more care before surgery also used more care after surgery. Clinicians should consider prior patterns of health care utilization, including utilization unrelated to the index condition, when determining care plans and prognosis.\", \"The aim of this study was to examine the procedures of primary dental health care performed by oral health teams (OHTs) adhering to the second cycle of the 'National Programme for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care' (PMAQ-AB) in Brazil. A cross-sectional descriptive analysis was performed, across 23 dental procedures comprising preventive, restorative/prosthetic, surgical, endodontic and oral cancer monitoring. Descriptive analysis shows that most of the oral health teams carry out basic dental procedures. However, most of the time, they do not keep adequate records of suspected cases of oral cancer, diagnosis tests or follow-ups, and do not perform dental prosthetic procedures. Data also showed disparities in the average number of procedures performed in each Brazilian geographical region in 2013-2014, ranging from 13.9 in the northern to 16.5 in the southern and south-eastern regions, reinforcing the great social disparities between them. Brazilian regions with the highest volume of dental need deliver the lowest number of dental procedures. The need to tackle inequalities and further shape the supply of appropriate primary health care (PHC) is evident.\", 'Background Having a sufficient and well-functioning health workforce is crucial for reducing the burden of disease and premature death. Health workforce development, focusing on availability, recruitment, retention, and education, is inseparable from acceptability, motivation, burnout, role and responsibility, and performance. Each aspect of workforce development may face several challenges, requiring specific strategies. However, there was little evidence on barriers and strategies towards comprehensive health workforce development. Therefore, this review explored barriers and strategies for health workforce development at the primary health care level around the world.Methods A scoping review of reviews was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. The article search was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. We used EndNote x9 for managing the collected articles, screening processes, and citation purpose. The scoping review included any kind of review articles on the application of health workforce development concepts, such as availability, recruitment, retention, role and responsibility, education and training, motivation, and burnout, with primary health care and published in English anywhere in the world. Based on the concepts above, barriers and strategies for health workforce development were identified. The findings were synthesized qualitatively based on the building blocks of the health system framework. The analysis involved specific activities such as familiarization, construction of the thematic framework, indexing, charting, and interpretation. The results were presented in texts, tables, and figures.Results The search strategies yielded 7,276 papers were found. Of which, 69 were included in the scoping review. The most frequently cited barriers were financial challenges and issues related to health care delivery, such as workloads. Barriers affecting healthcare providers directly, including lack of training and ineffective teamwork, were also prominent. Other health system and governance barriers include lack of support, unclear responsibility, and inequity. Another notable barrier was the shortage of health care technology, which pertains to both health care supplies and information technology. The most common cited effective strategies were ongoing support and supervision, engaging with communities, establishing appropriate primary care settings, financial incentives, fostering teamwork, and promoting autonomous health care practice.Conclusions Effective leadership/governance, a robust health financing system, integration of health information and technology, such as mobile health and ensuring a consistent supply of adequate resources are also vital components of primary health care workforce development. The findings highlight the importance of continuous professional development, which includes training new cadres, implementing effective recruitment and retention mechanisms, optimising the skill mix, and promoting workplace wellness. These elements are essential in fostering a well-trained and resilient primary health care workforce.', 'The accountable care organization (ACO) provides an opportunity to strategically design a comprehensive health system in which oral health works within primary care. A dental hygienist/therapist within the ACO represents value-based health care in action. Background Inspired by health care reform efforts in Minnesota, a vision of an accountable care organization that integrates oral health into primary health care was developed. Dental hygienists and dental therapists can help accelerate the integration of oral health into primary care, particularly in light of the compelling evidence confirming the cost-effectiveness of care delivered by an allied workforce. Methods A dental insurance Chief Operating Officer and a dental hygiene educator used their unique perspectives and experience to describe the potential of an interdisciplinary team-based approach to individual and population health, including oral health, via an accountable care community. Conclusions The principles of the patient-centered medical home and the vision for accountable care communities present a paradigm shift from a curative system of care to a prevention-based system that encompasses the behavioral, social, nutritional, economic, and environmental factors that impact health and well-being. Oral health measures embedded in the spectrum of general health care have the potential to ensure a truly comprehensive healthcare system.', \"Background: Older persons are often poorly served by existing models of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). We sought input from clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers on recommendations for system improvements. Methods: Focus group interviews were held with clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers in mid-sized urban and rural communities in Ontario. Data were analyzed using a combination of directed and emergent coding. Results were shared with participants during a series of feedback sessions. Results: An extensive list of barriers, facilitators, and recommended health system improvements was generated. Barriers included poor system integration and limited access to services. Identified facilitators were person and family-focused care, self-management resources, and successful collaborative practice. Recommended system improvements included expanding and integrating care teams, supports for system navigation, and development of standardized information systems and care pathways. Conclusions: Older adults still experience frustrating obstacles when trying to access CBPHC. Identified barriers and facilitators of improved system integration aligned well with current literature and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Additional work is needed to implement the recommended improvements and to discern their impact on patient and system outcomes.\", 'This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition under which increased health care productivity must lead to decreased (increased) demand for health care as long as the demand for health care is inelastic (elastic). It is shown that this condition identifies a class of health production functions, which may provide useful guidance to empirical studies that depend wholly or partly on the correct specification of a health production function. As an illustration, it is demonstrated that this class of production functions may be useful for empirical studies that test the hypothesis that schooling, increasing the efficiency of health production, leads to a larger health output from a given set of health inputs. The paper also offers broader classes of production functions that would enable one to test this relationship between the demand elasticity and the effect of health care productivity on health care demand. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.', 'The Primary Health Care strategy is based on organization of interdisciplinary teams and comprehensive approach to health, disease and health care processes. To strengthen information systems so that they represent primary health care complexities, participatory meetings were held with primary care practitioners from the public health care system of Buenos Aires City. Terms for the record tool and its components were chosen using consensus methodologies. This process involved 300 practitioners from 49 centers, and submission of 21 proposals. It was decided to change the term Electronic Medical Record with Comprehensive Health Record. It was also agreed that, apart from Reason for Consultation, the field Problem Situation would be added, that Care Service would be replaced with Care Act, and that a new module Health Team Management and Education Activities would be included to document practitioners team activities.', 'The term psychologically informed health care  refers to the comprehensive integration of psychological principles into health care. Psychologically informed health care has the potential to lead to a transformation of care, resulting in truly transdisciplinary care. To facilitate its future development, we discuss key characteristics of this approach. These include the direct mode (psychologists assessing and treating patients themselves) and indirect mode (psychologists working through other health care providers) of integrating psychological principles into healthcare; the range of health domains targeted using this approach; transdisciplinary care, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries; and the positioning of care. We describe a framework for transdisciplinary care, which we refer to as the Framework for Catalytic Collaboration. This framework comprises six dimensions: setting, disciplines, patients/clients, mode of psychological care, primary components of care, and primary targets of care. We also provide four brief illustrations of psychologically informed health care. Finally, we discuss future directions, including the need for professional recognition of the indirect mode, financing of the indirect mode, cross-disciplinary training and trans-disciplinary research.', \"Background: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care providers (PCPs) often see few women, making it challenging to maintain proficiency in women's health (WH). Therefore, VHA in 2010 established Designated WH Providers, who would maintain proficiency in comprehensive WH care and be preferentially assigned women patients. Objective: To evaluate early implementation of this national policy. Methods: At each VHA health care system (N = 140), the Women Veterans Program Manager completed a Fiscal Year 2012 workforce capacity assessment (response rate, 100%), representing the first time the national Designated WH Provider workforce had been identified. Assessment data were linked to administrative data. Results: Of all VHA PCPs, 23% were Designated WH Providers; 100% of health care systems and 83% of community clinics had at least 1 Designated WH Provider. On average, women veterans comprised 19% (SD = 27%) of the patients Designated WH Providers saw in primary care, versus 5% (SD = 7%) for Other PCPs (P < 0.001). For women veterans using primary care (N = 313,033), new patients were less likely to see a Designated WH Provider than established women veteran patients (52% vs. 64%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: VHA has achieved its goal of a Designated WH Provider in every health care system, and is approaching its goal of a Designated WH Provider at every hospital/community clinic. Designated WH Providers see more women than do Other PCPs. However, as the volume of women patients remains low for many providers, attention to alternative approaches to maintaining proficiency may prove necessary, and barriers to assigning new women patients to Designated WH Providers merit attention.\", 'Population health in the United States continues to lag behind other wealthy nations. Primary care has the promise of enhancing population health; however, the implementation of a population health approach within primary care deserves further consideration. Clinicians and staff from a national sample of 10 innovative primary care practices participated in a working conference to reflect upon population health approaches in primary care. A series of small- and large-group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and coded through an immersion/crystallization approach. Two prominent themes emerged: (1) Transitioning to a population health focus generally develops through stages, with early implementation focusing on risk stratification and later, more advanced stages focusing on community health; and (2) Several inherent barriers confront implementation of a population health approach, including tensions with patient-centered care, and limitations of health information technology. A broader conceptualization of population health in terms of community health could more effectively allow partnerships among primary care, large health care systems, public health organizations, patients, and other partners in the community.', \"Introduction: Research on partnerships between parents and health care professionals (HCPs) to improve adolescent health is limited. In this study, we have developed an empirically derived framework to guide research in this particular area. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups and in-depth semi-structured interviews. A total of 85 participants (51 HCPs, 17 mothers of patients of ages 12-18 years, and 17 adolescents) were recruited from three free-standing adolescent health clinics and five school-based health centers across North Carolina. We independently explored the perceptions of HCPs and mothers regarding the roles of parents, HCPs, and parent-HCP partnerships in preventing and addressing adolescent health problems. We then elicited feedback of adolescents on mother and HCP perceptions. We identified common and informative themes during content analysis using ATLAS. ti, and triangulated perspectives of HCPs, mothers, and adolescents to develop a framework for building parent-HCP partnerships to improve adolescent health. Results: A general framework emerged that conceptualizes both direct and indirect strategies for building parent-HCP partnerships. Direct strategies involve strengthening relationships and/or communication between parents and HCPs in both practice and community settings. Indirect strategies involve opportunities for HCPs to influence parent-adolescent relationships and/or communication within the context of adolescent visits. For example, HCPs can discuss the importance of parental involvement and monitoring with adolescents, encourage and facilitate parent-adolescent communication, and deliver tailored parental guidance while also respecting adolescents' desires for confidential health care when appropriate. Conclusions: Interventions that directly strengthen parent-HCP relationships and/or communication, and those that indirectly support parent-HCP partnerships within the context of adolescent health care, should be designed targeting health outcomes.

Infrastructural deficiencies of health services are reported in literature and research. A number of instruments exist for the assessment of infrastructure. However, no easy-to-use instruments to assess health facility infrastructure in developing countries are available. Present tools are not applicable for a rapid assessment by health facility staff. Therefore, health information systems lack data on facility infrastructure. Methods: A rapid assessment tool for the infrastructure of primary health care facilities was developed by the authors and pilot-tested in Tanzania. The tool measures the quality of all infrastructural components comprehensively and with high standardization. Ratings use a 2-1-0 scheme which is frequently used in Tanzanian health care services. Infrastructural indicators and indices are obtained from the assessment and serve for reporting and tracing of interventions. The tool was pilot-tested in Tanga Region (Tanzania). Results: The pilot test covered seven primary care facilities in the range between dispensary and district hospital. The assessment encompassed the facilities as entities as well as 42 facility buildings and 80 pieces of technical medical equipment. A full assessment of facility infrastructure was undertaken by health care professionals while the rapid assessment was performed by facility staff. Serious infrastructural deficiencies were revealed. The rapid assessment tool proved a reliable instrument of routine data collection by health facility staff. Conclusions: The authors recommend integrating the rapid assessment tool in the health information systems of developing countries. Health authorities in a decentralized health system are thus enabled to detect infrastructural deficiencies and trace the effects of interventions. The tool can lay the data foundation for district facility infrastructure management.', 'Background: Cambodia is a country where the resources for treating mental health disorders are far from sufficient. One strategy to narrow the treatment gap is to integrate mental health into primary health care (PHC). Understanding the knowledge and attitudes towards mental health integration that health-care workers have is important for assessing the challenges and opportunities when planning a potential integration project. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess these basic conditions in Lvea Em District, Cambodia. Design: A structured self-reporting questionnaire regarding attitudes and knowledge about mental health and its integration into PHC was collected from 75 health-care workers in Lvea Em District, Cambodia in October 2015. Firstly, descriptive analyses were carried out, and secondly, linear regression analyses to assess the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic variables were conducted. Results: There was clear support towards integrating mental health services into PHC among these participants as 81.3% were interested in personally delivering mental health care at their units. Respondents who reported having received some kind of mental health-care training tended to have a more positive attitude towards mentally ill people (p = 0.005) and those who thought there was a high need for mental health care had a more favourable attitude towards the integration of mental health services (p = 0.007). Conclusions: The most important finding from this survey was the willingness and the acceptance of the need for integration of mental health care. This enhances the feasibility of integrating mental health services at the PHC level. Improving the competence of mental health care in these settings will likely help to reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in Cambodia.', \"Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is the future that is already here. Despite its potential as a transformational force for primary care, most primary care providers (PCPs) do not know what it is, how it will impact them and their patients, and what its key limitations and ethical pitfalls are. This article is a beginner's guide to health care AI, written for the frontline PCP. Primary care-as the dominant force at the base of the health care pyramid, with its unrivaled interconnectedness to every part of the health system and its deep relationship with patients and communities-is the most uniquely suited specialty to lead the health care AI revolution. PCPs can advance health care AI by partnering with technologists to ensure that AI use cases are relevant and human-centered, applying quality improvement methods to health care AI implementations, and advocating for inclusive and ethical AI that combats, rather than worsens, health inequities.\", 'Background Child care workers play an important role in caring for children attending child care yet there is little research regarding their health. Methods The study consisted of focus groups with child care workers and a survey, conducted as part of a larger study known as the Healthy Child Care Study, which focused on children. The study investigated carers working in formal child care [long day care (LDC) and family day care (FDC)]. Results Questionnaires to caregivers in centres showed that 86% had taken sick leave in the previous year and 75% of staff had taken leave for infectious illness. Carers in FDC reported that 24% had taken sick leave in the previous year and 12% of carers had taken leave for infectious illness. Of responding caregivers from centres, 22% were cigarette smokers while in FDC homes, 8% of carers smoked. In focus groups, carers reported that their major areas of health concern were stress, infectious illness and physical trauma such as lifting injuries. Conclusions Child care workers in LDC took more sick leave than those in FDC but this is not necessarily due to more illness. Child care workers are a diverse and important group that require further research.', \"PURPOSE It has been suggested that the best way to improve chronic illness care is through a redesign of primary care emphasizing comprehensive, coordinated care as espoused by the Chronic Care Model (CCM). This study examined the relationship between primary care orientation and the implementation of the CCM in physician organizations. METHODS The relationship between measures of primary care orientation and the CCM was examined in a sample of 957 physician organizations from the National Study of Physician Organizations, a cross-sectional telephone survey of all US medical groups and independent practice associations with 20 or more physicians (response rate, 70%). RESULTS After adjusting for potential confounders, 6 of 8 measures of primary care orientation were associated with physician organizations' adoption of 11 elements of CCM chronic care management. These 6 measures were severity of chronic illness treated in primary care, health promotion activity, health education activity, any accepted financial risk for hospitalization, required reporting, and presence of an electronic standardized problem list. Presence of an electronic medical record and the 5-year primary care physician turnover rate were not associated. CONCLUSIONS Organizations that have adopted 6 core attributes of primary care, representing comprehensive health service delivery and a commitment to overall patient health, appear to use more chronic care management practices. Policy makers and other stakeholders may wish to focus on creating an improved primary care home in their quest to close the quality chasm in chronic illness care.\", 'Purpose: Transgender veterans are overrepresented in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) compared with in the general population. Utilization of multiple different health care systems, or health care mobility, can affect care coordination and potentially affect outcomes, either positively or negatively. This study examines whether transgender veterans are more or less health care mobile than nontransgender veterans and compares the patterns of geographic mobility in these groups. Methods: Using an established cohort (n = 5,414,109), we identified 2890 transgender veterans from VHA electronic health records from 2000 to 2012. We compared transgender and nontransgender veterans on sociodemographic, clinical, and health care system-level measures and conducted conditional logistic regression models of mobility. Results: Transgender veterans were more likely to be younger, White, homeless, have depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and hepatitis C. Transgender veterans were more likely to have been health care mobile (9.9%) than nontransgender veterans (5.2%) (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.73-2.36). In a multivariable model, transgender status, being separated/divorced, receiving care in less-complex facilities, and diagnoses of depression, PTSD, or hepatitis C were associated with more mobility, whereas older age was associated with less mobility. For the top three health care systems utilized, a larger proportion of transgender veterans visited a second health care system in a different state (56.2%) than nontransgender veterans (37.5%). Conclusions: Transgender veterans were more likely to be health care mobile and more likely to travel out of state for health care services. They were also more likely to have complex chronic health conditions that require multidisciplinary care.', \"Background and Objectives: Few who experience sexual assault seek health care immediately. Yet many become heavy users of health care resources in the years postassault because sexual violence has been linked with both acute and chronic health consequences. Our objective was to investigate servicewomen's medical and mental health (MH) care utilization after sexual assault in-military (SAIM) and identify reasons for not seeking care. Methods: In a retrospective cross-sectional Midwestern community sample of OEF/OIF Active Component and Reserve/National Guard servicewomen, currently serving and veterans, computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 207 servicewomen who experienced SAIM. Results: A quarter (25%) received post-SAIM MH care and 16% medical care. Utilization of medical care tended to be sooner (within the first month) and MH care later (6mo to 1+y). Most sought care on a military base, a third from civilian providers, and 10% sought MH from Veterans Health Administration. Servicewomen were more likely to have utilized medical care if they had experienced a completed SAIM and made a Department of Defense SAIM report and MH care if they were white, experienced on-duty SAIM, and made a Department of Defense SAIM report. The most common reason for not seeking medical care was due to belief that care was not needed. Reasons for not utilizing medical or MH care included embarrassment, confidentiality concerns, and fear of adverse career consequences. Conclusions: Few servicewomen utilized post-SAIM care, thus assault-specific health consequences were likely unaddressed. Given the severe and chronic consequences of sexual assault, our findings emphasize need for military, Veterans Health Administration, and civilian providers to query SAIM history to provide timely and optimal care.\", \"Current trends in health care delivery and management such as predictive and personalized health care incorporating information and communication technologies, home-based care, health prevention and promotion through patients' empowerment, care coordination, community health networks and governance represent exciting possibilities to dramatically improve health care. However, as a whole, current health care trends involve a fragmented and scattered array of practices and uncoordinated pilot projects. The present paper describes an innovative and integrated model incorporating and assembling best practices and projects of new innovations into an overarching health care system that can effectively address the multidimensional health care challenges related to aging patient especially with chronic health issues. The main goal of the proposed model is to address the emerging health care challenges of an aging population and stimulate improved cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and patients' well-being. The proposed home-based and community-centered Integrated Healthcare Management System may facilitate reaching the persons in their natural context, improving early detection, and preventing illnesses. The system allows simplifying the health care institutional structures through interorganizational coordination, increasing inclusiveness and extensiveness of health care delivery. As a consequence of such coordination and integration, future merging efforts of current health care approaches may provide feasible solutions that result in improved cost-efficiency of health care services and simultaneously increase the quality of life, in particular, by switching the center of gravity of health delivery to a close relationship of individuals in their communities, making best use of their personal and social resources, especially effective in health delivery for aging persons with complex chronic illnesses.\", \"Most studies have concluded that good prenatal care plays an essential role in improving birth outcomes, and numerous reports have documented barriers to adequate prenatal care. The relationship between health care insurance eligibility and enrollment procedures and adequacy of prenatal care, however, has not been suitably investigated. This study used data from a statewide representative sample of recently delivered women in South Carolina to assess (1) patterns of health care insurance source and (2) the independent effects of Medicaid enrollment and application procedures on receipt of prenatal care. Health insurance during pregnancy varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Black women's experiences with Medicaid enrollment and application procedures were associated with less than adequate prenatal care. Programmatic efforts and policies should emphasize further improvement in the systems of health care access and delivery to disadvantaged women.\", \"Background/Objectives Medicare-certified home health agencies are required to offer family caregiver training, but little is known regarding the potential impact of this training on outcomes during home health care. We estimate the proportion of family caregivers assisting Medicare home health patients who have unmet training needs and examine whether these unmet training needs are associated with older adults' risk of acute care utilization during home health care. Design Observational, nationally representative cohort study. Setting Linked National Health and Aging Trends Study, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Medicare Provider of Services file, and Medicare claims data from 2011 to 2016. Participants Thousand two hundred seventeen (weighted n = 5,870,905) community-living Medicare beneficiaries who received home health care between 2011 and 2016. Measurements Family caregivers' unmet training needs measured from OASIS and Medicare claims; home health patients' acute care utilization (including emergency department use and hospitalization) measured from OASIS. Results Rates of unmet need for training varied by activity, from 8.2% of family caregivers assisting with household chores to 16.0% assisting with self-care tasks. After controlling for older adult and home health provider characteristics, older adults whose family caregivers had an unmet need for training with any caregiving activity were twice as likely to incur acute care utilization during their home health episode (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-3.38). This relationship held across specific caregiving activities including household chores (aOR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.13-3.46), medication management (aOR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.46-4.26), patient supervision (aOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.36-6.24), and self-care tasks (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.62-6.00). Conclusions and Relevance Unmet training needs among family caregivers are associated with greater likelihood of acute care utilization among Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health care. Identifying and addressing family caregivers' training needs may reduce older adults' risk of acute care utilization during home health care.\", \"Objective: Explore the perceptions of patients and health care professionals about patients' ideas, concerns, expectations (ICE), and satisfaction in consultations with general practitioners (GPs), district nurses (DNs) and physiotherapists (PTs). Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire study of participants in planned consultations. Setting: Five primary health care centers and two rehabilitation centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects: Pairs of patients and GPs (n = 156), patients and DNs (n = 73), and patients and PTs (n = 69). Main outcome measures: Multiple-choice questions about patients' ICE and satisfaction. Results: Approximately 75% of patients and GPs reported that patients' thoughts and explanations about their symptoms emerged during the consultation. For patient-DN pairs, the figure was 60%, and for patient-PT pairs, 80%. A majority of patients reported not having concerns and anxiety about the investigation/treatment, whereas health care professionals thought patients were more concerned. One-third of patients consulting GPs and PTs expected to receive a reason/explanation for their symptoms. Figures were lower for the DNs. About 70% of patients were satisfied with the consultation. Conclusions: Most patients expressed their ideas, a minority had concerns, and a minority expected an explanation of their illness. Patients and health care professionals rated patient satisfaction high, but health care professionals tended to believe patients were less satisfied than patients reported they were.\", \"This article compares the organization of the Swedish health care system with that in three other countries, the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, focussing on three main areas: (1) the provision and financing (public or private) of health insurance, including the question of the quality of the insurance protection offered; (2) the organization of the production of health services, and the economic incentives on the system's decision-makers (doctors, hospital managers, politicians, etc.). Possible answers are suggested to the question why one country (the U.K.) is able to provide health care to its population at an average cost considerably below that of the others: Differences in the quality of the insurance protection and health services; in the incentives on the system managers to exercise cost control; and in the incentives on service providers such as physicians, to consider cost-effectiveness when making treatment decisions. An attempt is made to suggest lessons for health care reform in Sweden and elsewhere.\", 'Utilization-based approaches have predominated the measurement of socioeconomic-related inequity in health care. This approach, however, can be misleading when preferences over health and health care are correlated with socioeconomic status, especially when the underlying focus is on equity of access. We examine the potential usefulness of an alternative approach to assessing inequity of access using a direct measure of possible barriers to access-self-reported unmet need (SUN)-which is documented to vary with socioeconomic status and is commonly asked in health surveys. Specifically, as part of an assessment of its external validity, we use Canadian longitudinal health data to test whether self-reported unmet need in one period is associated with a subsequent deterioration in health status in a future period, and find that it is. This suggests that SUN does reflect in part reduced access to needed health care, and therefore may have a role in assessing health system equity as a complement to utilization-based approaches.', 'Population health care is health information and clinical services provided to individuals of a defined population. From a population health care perspective, quality of care involves the health status of the entire population, and thus issues of access, cost of care, and efficiency matter. In this paper, we describe the definitions of quality health care and the framework for measuring quality, with emphasis on the performance of organizations involved in the delivery and assurance of population health care. We describe quality measurement sets and systems, criteria for the choice of measures, data sources, and how quality measurements are used to improve health care and outcomes from a population health care perspective.', 'We show that when health care providers have market power and engage in Cournot competition, a competitive upstream health insurance market results in over-insurance and over-priced health care. Even though consumers and firms anticipate the price interactions between these two markets - the price set in one market affects the demand expressed in the other - Pareto improvements are possible. The results suggest a beneficial role for Government intervention, either in the insurance or the health care market. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit variation in treatment intensity from 2 sources: (1) local area prereform uninsured rates from 2013 and (2) state participation in the Medicaid expansion. Including the third postreform year leads to 2 important insights. First, gains in health insurance coverage and access to care from the policy continued to increase in the third year. Second, an improvement in the probability of reporting excellent health emerged in the third year, with the effect being largely driven by the non-Medicaid expansions components of the policy.', 'Objectives: Dental care for elderly nursing home residents is traditionally provided at fixed dental clinics, but domiciliary dental care is an emerging alternative. Longer life expectancy accompanied with increased morbidity, and hospitalisation or dependence on the care of others will contribute to a risk for rapid deterioration of oral health so alternative methods for delivering oral health care to vulnerable individuals for whom access to fixed dental clinics is an obstacle should be considered. The aim was to analyse health economic consequences of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents in Sweden, compared to dentistry at a fixed clinic. Methods: A review of relevant literature was undertaken complemented by interviews with nursing home staff, officials at county councils, and academic experts in geriatric dentistry. Domiciliary dental care and fixed clinic care were compared in cost analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. Results: The mean societal cost of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents was lower than dental care at a fixed clinic, and it was also considered cost-effective. Lower cost of dental care at a fixed dental clinic was only achieved in a scenario where dental care could not be completed in a domiciliary setting. Conclusions: Domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents has a lower societal cost and is cost-effective compared to dental care at fixed clinics. To meet current and predicted need for oral health care in the ageing population alternative methods to deliver dental care should be available.', 'Health disparities, also known as health inequities, are systematic and potentially remediable differences in one or more aspects of health across population groups defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically (88). This topic has been the subject of research stretching back at least decades. Reports and studies have delved into how inequities develop in different societies and, with particular regard to health services, in access to and financing of health systems. In this review, we consider empirical studies from the United States and elsewhere, and we focus on how one aspect of health systems, clinical care, contributes to maintaining systematic differences in health across population groups characterized by social disadvantage. We consider inequities in clinical care and the policies that influence them. We develop a framework for considering the structural and behavioral components of clinical care and review the existing literature for evidence that is likely to be generalizable across health systems over time. Starting with the assumption that health services, as one aspect of social services, ought to enhance equity in health care, we conclude with a discussion of threats to that role and what might be done about them.', 'Background:This paper provides statewide estimates on health care access and utilization patterns and physical and behavioral health by citizenship and documentation status among Latinos in California.Methods:This study used data from the 2011-2015 California Health Interview Survey to examine health care access and utilization and physical and behavioral health among a representative sample of all nonelderly Latino and US-born non-Latino white adults (N=51,386). Multivariable regressions estimated the associations between the dependent measures and citizenship/documentation status among Latinos (US-born, naturalized citizen, green card holder, and undocumented).Results:Adjusted results from multivariable analyses observed worse access and utilization patterns among immigrant Latinos compared with US-born Latinos, with undocumented immigrants using significantly less health care. Undocumented Latinos had lower odds of self-reporting excellent/very good health status compared with US-born Latinos, despite them having lower odds of having several physical and behavioral health outcomes (overweight/obesity, physician-diagnosed hypertension, asthma, self-reported psychological distress, and need for behavioral health services). Among those reporting a need for behavioral health services, access was also worse for undocumented Latinos when compared with US-born Latinos.Conclusions:Patterns of poor health care access and utilization and better physical and behavioral health are observed across the continuum of documentation status, with undocumented immigrants having the worst access and utilization patterns and less disease. Despite fewer reported diagnoses and better mental health, undocumented Latinos reported poorer health status than their US-born counterparts.', 'Objective To evaluate differences in access to behavioral health services for Medicaid enrollees covered by a Medicaid entity that integrated the financing of behavioral and physical health care (carve-in group) versus a Medicaid entity that separated this financing (carve-out group). Data Sources/Study Setting Medicaid claims data from two Medicaid entities in the Portland, Oregon tri-county area in 2016. Study Design In this cross-sectional study, we compared differences across enrollees in the carve-in versus carve-out group, using a machine learning approach to incorporate a large set of covariates and minimize potential selection bias. Our primary outcomes included behavioral health visits for a variety of different provider types. Secondary outcomes included inpatient, emergency department, and primary care visits. Data Collection We used Medicaid claims, including adults with at least 9 months of enrollment. Principal Findings The study population included 45,786 adults with mental health conditions. Relative to the carve-out group, individuals in the carve-in group were more likely to access outpatient behavioral health (2.39 percentage points, p < 0.0001, with a baseline rate of approximately 73%). The carve-in group was also more likely to access primary care physicians, psychologists, and social workers and less likely to access psychiatrists and behavioral health specialists. Access to outpatient behavioral health visits was more likely in the carve-in arrangement among individuals with mild or moderate mental health conditions (compared to individuals with severe mental illness) and among black enrollees (compared to white enrollees). Conclusions Financial integration of physical and behavioral health in Medicaid managed care was associated with greater access to behavioral health services, particularly for individuals with mild or moderate mental health conditions and for black enrollees. Recent changes to incentivize financial integration should be monitored to assess differential impacts by illness severity, race and ethnicity, provider types, and other factors.', \"This study concerns measuring the quality of health services in long-term residential mental health care. The issue of measuring the quality of health services has been limited to services at residential health care centers (ZOL). The aim of the study is to propose measures associated with the provision of services in long-term residential mental health care. Currently, there are no tools for measuring the psychiatric services provided. The consequence of that is that the monitoring-supervisory-control mechanism that should ensure the required level of quality of services provided in this area of psychiatric care is inefficient. The aim of the deliberations made in this study is presenting an appropriate set of measures to assess the performance of a residential health care provider, taking into account the specificity of long-term mental health care (ZOL). The application of the Team Patient Functioning Scale allows for the specification of the changes occurring in the patient's functioning and comparing them at time intervals, and indirectly causes the Team Patient Functioning Scale to be used to draw conclusions about the aggravation, stabilization, or regression of the illness, and to prove the effectiveness of the therapeutic team. The presented results of the application of the proposed measures may constitute a reference base - as a benchmark - for the improvement and development of the quality of health services for patients in residential health care centers in Poland.\", 'OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to compare the receipt of preventive health services for children with and without special health care needs and to identify predictors of these health services for children with special health care needs using nationally representative data. METHODS. Data from the 2002 and 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were analyzed. A total of 18 279 children aged 3 to 17 years were included in our study. The Child Preventive Health Supplement was used to identify caregiver recall of specific health screening measures and anticipatory guidance during the previous 12 months. Odds ratios were calculated for predictive factors of preventive services for children with special health care needs. RESULTS. The prevalence of special health care needs in children aged 3 to 17 years was 21.6%. Based on caregiver reports, 87.5% of children with special health care needs had >= 1 health screening measure checked in the past year compared with 73.1% of children without special health care needs. Receipt of >= 1 topic of anticipatory guidance was reported for 69.8% of children with special health care needs compared with 55.2% of children without special health care needs. Black and Hispanic caregivers of children with special health care needs were more likely than others to report receipt of all 6 categories of anticipatory guidance measured in this study. CONCLUSIONS. We found that caregivers of children with special health care needs were more likely to report receipt of anticipatory guidance and health screening than were caregivers of children without special health care needs. Although a majority of these caregivers reported receiving some health screening and anticipatory guidance on an annual basis, there are clear gaps in the delivery of preventive health services. This study identifies areas for improvement in the delivery of preventive health services for children with special health care needs and children in general.', \"The dental hygienist team member has an opportunity to coordinate care within an interprofessional practice as an oral health care manager. Background and purpose Although dental hygienists are currently practicing within interprofessional teams in settings such as pediatric offices, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and federally qualified health centers, they often still assume traditional responsibilities rather than practicing to the full extent of their training and licenses. This article explains the opportunity for the dental hygiene professional to embrace patient-centered care as an oral health care manager who can facilitate integration of oral and primary care in a variety of health care settings. Methods Based on an innovative model of collaboration between a college of dentistry and a college of nursing, an idea emerged among several faculty members for a new management method for realizing continuity and coordination of comprehensive patient care. Involved faculty members began working on the development of an approach to interprofessional practice with the dental hygienist serving as an oral health care manager who would address both oral health care and a patient's related primary care issues through appropriate referrals and follow-up. This approach is explained in this article, along with the results of several pilot studies that begin to evaluate the feasibility of a dental hygienist as an oral health care manager. Conclusion A health care provider with management skills and leadership qualities is required to coordinate the interprofessional provision of comprehensive health care. The dental hygienist has the opportunity to lead closer integration of oral and primary care as an oral health care manager, by coordinating the team of providers needed to implement comprehensive, patient-centered care.\", 'We investigate how utilization of primary care, specialist care, and emergency department (ED) care (and the mix across the three) changes in response to a change in health need. We determine whether any changes in utilization are impacted by socio-economic status. The use of a unique Australian data set that consists of a large survey linked to multiple years of detailed administrative records enables us to better control for individual heterogeneity and allows us to exploit changes in health that are related to the onset of two health shocks: a new diagnosis of diabetes and heart disease. We extend the analysis by also examining changes to patient out-of-pocket costs. We find significant differences in the mix between primary and specialist care use according to income and type of health shock but no evidence of using ED as a substitute for other care. Our results indicate that low- and high-income patients navigate very different pathways for their care following the onset of diabetes and to a lesser extent heart disease. These pathways appear to be chosen on the basis of ability to pay, rather than the most effective or efficient bundle of care delivered through a combination of GP and specialist care.', \"Background The recent Austrian Primary Care Act established new primary health care units (PHCUs) and obliged them to draw up a care strategy specifying their focal care tasks and objectives and emphasizing the health care needs of the population in their catchment area with its specific local health and epidemiological profile. The main purpose of these care strategies is thus to ensure that care-providers meet the local needs, but they also provide a rationale for evaluation and organizational development. To assist new PHCUs in establishing care strategies it was necessary to develop a method for automatically generating comprehensive local case studies for any freely definable location in Austria. Results We designed an interactive report generator capable of producing location-specific regional health care profiles for a PHCU located in any of Austria's 2122 municipalities and of calculating the radius of its catchment area (defined by different levels of maximum car-travelling times). The reports so generated, called regional health care profiles for primary health care (RHCPs/PHC), are in comprehensive PDF report format. The core of each report is a set of 35 indicators, classified under five health and health service domains. The reports include an introductory text, definitions, a map, a graphic and tabular presentation of all indicator values, including information on local, supra-regional and national value distribution, a ranking, and numbers of service providers (e.g. pharmacies, surgeries, nursing homes) located within the catchment area. Conclusions The RHCPs/PHC support primary health care planning, efforts to improve care-effectiveness, and strategic organizational development by providing comprehensive information on the health of the population, the utilization of health services and the health care structures within the catchment area. In addition to revealing the scope and nature of the health care needed, they also provide information on what public health approaches are necessary. RHCPs/PHC for different locations have already been distributed to numerous stakeholders and primary health care providers in Austria.\", 'Objective. To assess the role health insurance plays in influencing access to care and use of services by children with special health care needs. Methods. We analyzed data on 57 553 children younger than 18 years old included in the 1994-1995 National Health Interview Survey on Disability. The survey obtained information on special health care needs, insurance status, and access to and use of health services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of insurance with several measures of access and utilization, including usual source of care, site of usual care, missed or delayed care, and use of ambulatory physician services. Results. Using the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau definition of children with special health care needs, we estimate that 18% of US children under 18 years old had an existing special health care need in 1994-1995. An estimated 89% of these children had some form of health insurance coverage, most often private health insurance. Insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have a usual source of care (96.9% vs 79.2%). Among those with a usual source of care, insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have an identified regular clinician (87.6% vs 80.7%). Insured children were less likely to report unmet health needs, including medical care (2.2% vs 10.5%), dental care (6.1% vs 23.9%), prescriptions, and/or eyeglasses (3.1% vs 12.3%), and mental health care (.9% vs 3.4%). Insured children were also more likely to have a physician contact in the past year (89.3% vs 73.6%) and have more physician contacts on an annual basis (8.5 vs 4.1 contacts). Unexpectedly, no differences were found between insured and uninsured children in availability of after hours medical care (evenings and weekends) or satisfaction with care. We also found some modest differences in access between publicly and privately insured children. Privately insured children were more likely to have a usual source of care (97.6% vs 95.3%) and a regular clinician (91.0% vs 81.1%). Privately insured children were also less likely to report dissatisfaction with care at their usual site of care (14.9% vs 21.0%) and have access to care on evenings and weekends (6.8% vs 13.4%). No substantial differences were found between privately and publicly insured children in prevalence of unmet health needs or delays in obtaining care due to cost. Conclusions. This study illustrates the importance of health insurance for children with special health care needs. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that all children with special health care needs have insurance and that remaining access and utilization barriers for currently insured children with special health care needs are also addressed.', 'This article addresses the contribution that health care research can make to facilitating appropriate health care provision for older adults. First, the major risks in this age group are described. These include multiple illnesses, the increasing need for nursing care with age, but also the growing numbers of older adults with psychological disorders, primarily dementia. The second section of the article presents a critical assessment of the current health care situation in light of the risks identified. On this basis, the third section specifies the areas of health care research that can contribute to improving the quality of the health care provision for this population. The article is based on a presentation made by the author at the 2010 Berlin Talks on Social Medicine: The New Old - Health Care Research for a Changed Society.', \"INTRODUCTION A healthy workforce is vital for maintaining social and economic development on a global, national and local level. Around half of the world's people are economically active and spend at least one third of their time in their place of work while only 15% of workers have access to basic occupational health services. According to WHO report, since the early 1980s, health indicators in Iran have consistently improved, to the extent that it is comparable with those in developed countries. In this paper it was tried to briefly describe about Health care system and occupational Health Services as part of Primary Health care in Iran. METHODS To describe the health care system in the country and the status of occupational health services to the workers and employers, its integration into Primary Health Care (PHC) and outlining the challenges in provision of occupational health services to the all working population. FINDINGS Iran has fairly good health indicators. More than 85 percent of the population in rural and deprived regions, for instance, have access to primary healthcare services. The PHC centers provide essential healthcare and public-health services for the community. Providing, maintaining and improving of the workers' health are the main goals of occupational health services in Iran that are presented by different approaches and mostly through Workers' Houses in the PHC system. CONCLUSIONS Iran has developed an extensive network of PHC facilities with good coverage in most rural areas, but there are still few remote areas that might suffer from inadequate services. It seems that there is still no transparent policy to collaborate with the private sector, train managers or provide a sustainable mechanism for improving the quality of services. Finally, strengthening national policies for health at work, promotion of healthy work and work environment, sharing healthy work practices, developing updated training curricula to improve human resource knowledge including occupational health professionals are recommended.

However, less is known about whether postpartum health care receipt varies by the source of prenatal care.Materials and Methods: This study analyzed data from the 2011-2017 U.S. National Survey of Family Growth to examine associations between the source of prenatal care (private care facility, public/community health facility, other source, or no prenatal care) and nonreceipt of postpartum health care using weighted multivariable logistic regression models. This analysis did not require institutional review board approval.Results: Of the total estimation sample (N = 1,190), 10.8% of respondents reported not receiving postpartum health care. There were no statistically significant differences in nonreceipt of postpartum health care between women who received prenatal care from a public/community health facility or other source and those who attended a private facility. However, women who received no prenatal care had a higher likelihood of not receiving postpartum health care compared with those who attended a private facility (adjusted odds ratio 8.7, 95% confidence interval 4.3-17.5).Conclusions: Receiving prenatal care, regardless of the source, reduced the likelihood of a woman not receiving postpartum health care within a year after delivery. Interventions aimed at women who did not receive any prenatal care may be critical for improving postpartum health care use and subsequently preventing adverse maternal outcomes.', 'The care of pediatric patients with cancer and their families is complex and rapidly evolving. Despite significant advances in outcomes, symptoms of the disease and complications of therapy continue to cause suffering that may improve with the involvement of pediatric palliative care (PPC) services. This descriptive study responds to the observation of great variability in PPC utilization within pediatric oncology. Data collected from 156 health care professionals (nurses, advanced practice professionals, and physicians) from a statewide hematology alliance evaluates the knowledge, beliefs, and perceived barriers to PPC involvement. Data analysis reveals significant variability when comparing respondents from professional roles and practice environments. Despite progress in PPC availability, care delivery remains incongruent with current recommendations. Knowledge gained from this study emphasizes the important role for all health care providers in advocating for support of PPC programs, educating the public, and committing to intentional involvement of PPC services while caring for pediatric oncology patients.', \"BACKGROUND. Quantified measures of unmet health care needs can be used to evaluate health care interventions, assess the impact of managed care, monitor health status trends in populations, or assess equity of access to medical care across population subgroups. Such a measure needs to be simple, relatively easy to obtain, inexpensive, and appropriately targeted to the population of interest. OBJECTIVE. TO develop a measure of unmet health care needs that is specifically targeted to a pediatric population. SUBJECTS. Study participants consisted of children, aged 1 to 5 years (n = 1,031), and adolescent mothers, aged 13 to 19 years (n = 172), predominantly from poor, minority families in New York City. RESEARCH DESIGN. Based on a measure, the symptoms-response ratio, developed for all age groups, this study replicated Taylor's procedures specifically for children and adolescents. Respondents were asked if they had experienced a set of physical symptoms and if they saw a doctor in response. A panel of pediatricians rated the same symptoms as to whether health care should be sought. RESULTS. The measure achieved adequate inter-rater reliability and good construct validity. The children's overall use of health services did not differ from the pediatric panel's expectations, but with differing degrees of unmet needs by symptom. Adolescents sought care less often than the expert panel members believed they should. CONCLUSIONS. The symptoms-response ratio provides a good balance of a simple and inexpensive measure while yielding a fair estimate of unmet needs for primary care. This analysis created a pediatric measure targeted to the needs of young children and adolescent females.\", 'Background: Like other colonised populations, Indigenous Australians experience poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous Australians. Preventable chronic disease is the largest contributor to the health differential between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, but recommended best-practice preventive care is not consistently provided to Indigenous Australians. Significant improvement in health care delivery could be achieved through identifying and minimising evidence-practice gaps. Our objective was to use clinical audit data to create a framework of the priority evidence-practice gaps, strategies to address them, and drivers to support these strategies in the delivery of recommended preventive care. Methods: De-identified preventive health clinical audit data from 137 primary health care (PHC) centres in five jurisdictions were analysed (n = 17,108 audited records of well adults with no documented major chronic disease; 367 system assessments; 2005-2014), together with stakeholder survey data relating to interpretation of these data, using a mixed-methods approach (n = 152 responses collated in 2015-16). Stakeholders surveyed included clinicians, managers, policy officers, continuous quality improvement (CQI) facilitators and academics. Priority evidence-practice gaps and associated barriers, enablers and strategies to address the gaps were identified and reported back through two-stages of consultation. Further analysis and interpretation of these data were used to develop a framework of strategies and drivers for health service improvement. Results: Stakeholder identified priorities were: following-up abnormal test results; completing cardiovascular risk assessments; timely recording of results; recording enquiries about living conditions, family relationships and substance use; providing support for clients identified with emotional wellbeing risk; enhancing systems to enable team function and continuity of care. Drivers identified for improving care in these areas included: strong Indigenous participation in the PHC service; appropriate team structure and function to support preventive care; meaningful use of data to support quality of care and CQI; and corporate support functions and structures. Conclusion: The framework should be useful for guiding development and implementation of barrier-driven, tailored interventions for primary health care service delivery and policy contexts, and for guiding further research. While specific strategies to improve the quality of preventive care need to be tailored to local context, these findings reinforce the requirement for multi-level action across the system. The framework and findings may be useful for similar purposes in other parts of the world, with appropriate attention to context in different locations.', \"Background: Transgender people face a multitude of health care access barriers that create wide disparities in health. Transgender people have more untreated acute and chronic conditions than the cisgender population. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe positive and negative experiences of transgender people when accessing health care. Methodological orientation: Qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews and content analysis for identification of themes. Sample: Nine transgender people ranging in age from 20 to 35 years who currently reside in a metropolitan area of the Southwestern United States. Conclusions: The interviews contained candid stories about the participants' health care experiences and included perspectives about provider knowledge, provider communication, and provider office interactions. Findings identified health care disparities among transgender people related, in part, to negative experiences in the health care environment. Some of these negative experiences arose from the uncertainty of providers' transgender-specific health care knowledge and anxiety about dysphoria-triggering communication in the health care environment. Implications for practice: These findings enhance practice by offering insight into how health care providers and personnel interactions influence the experience of transgender patients and help health care providers and personnel understand situations that create anxiety and dysphoria in transgender patients.\", 'Background: Asian Americans have lower cancer screening rates than non-Latino Whites, suggesting inequities in cancer prevention among Asian Americans. Little is known about inequities in cancer treatment between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer. Methods: Using the 2002-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined inequities in access to care and health care spending between Whites and Asian Americans with and without cancer. Our outcomes included 3 measures of access to care and 3 measures of health care spending. We used multivariable regressions while adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need factors and estimated the mean adjusted values of the outcomes for each group. We then examined the differences in these adjusted mean outcomes among Asian Americans relative to Whites. Results: We observed evidence of inequities that Asian Americans without cancer experienced limited access to care due to a lack of a usual source of care. The likelihood of having a usual source of care was lower among Asian Americans without cancer than Whites without cancer. Inequities were not observed among Asian Americans with cancer. Compared with Whites with cancer, Asian Americans with cancer had similar or better levels of access to care. No or marginal differences in health care spending were detected between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer. These findings were consistent in both nonelderly and elderly groups. Conclusion: While Asian Americans without cancer have unmet medical needs due to limited access to care, access to care and spending are relatively equitable between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer.', 'Quality of care worries and rising costs have resulted in a widespread interest in enhancing the efficiency of health care delivery. One area of increasing interest is in promoting teamwork as a way of coordinating efforts to reduce costs and improve quality, and identifying the characteristics of the work environment that support teamwork. Relational climate is a measure of the work environment that captures shared employee perceptions of teamwork, conflict resolution, and diversity acceptance. Previous research has found a positive association between relational climate and quality of care, yet its relationship with costs remains unexplored. We examined the influence of primary care relational climate on health care costs incurred by diabetic patients at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs between 2008 and 2012. We found that better relational climate is significantly related to lower costs. Clinics with the strongest relational climate saved $334 in outpatient costs per patient compared with facilities with the weakest score in 2010. The total outpatient cost saving if all clinics achieved the top 5% relational climate score was $20 million. Relational climate may contribute to lower costs by enhancing diabetic treatment work processes, especially in outpatient settings.', \"OBJECTIVES. To determine the best predictors of the amount of children's health care use. RESEARCH DESIGN. Child health, psychosocial, and family status variables were collected. Families were then followed prospectively for 2 years to gather health care use data. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine factors related to volume of child health care use. SUBJECTS. 367 mothers and children ages 5 to 11 years continuously enrolled in a staff model HMO. MEASURES. Child health care visits obtained from a computerized database comprised the dependent variable. Independent variables were organized into a 5-component framework including: Demographic Characteristics; Family Characteristics; Child Health and Prior Health Care Use; Child Behavior and Mental Health; and Mothers' Mental Health and Health Care Use. RESULTS. The volume of a child's past health care use was the best predictor of future health care use, with the presence of past acute recurring illnesses, child pain and mother's retrospective health care use also serving as significant predictors in the model. Analysis of a second model was conducted omitting children's past use of health care. In this model the mother's worry about child health was the best predictor of use, with child health and child and maternal psychosocial variables significantly contributing to explained variance in the model. CONCLUSIONS. This study supports prior research indicating past use is the best predictor of future health care use. In addition, the study suggests that maternal perceptions of child health and maternal emotional functioning influence the decision-making process involved in seeking health care on behalf of children. Effective management of pediatric health care use needs to address broader needs of the child and family beyond solely the child's health, most notably maternal functioning.\", 'Background: Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent worldwide. Passive sensing technologies and applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods can provide an innovative means of supporting the management of mental health problems and enhancing the quality of care. However, the views of stakeholders are important in understanding the potential barriers to and facilitators of their implementation. Objective: This study aims to review, critically appraise, and synthesize qualitative findings relating to the views of mental health care professionals on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care. Methods: A systematic search of qualitative studies was performed using 4 databases. A meta-synthesis approach was used, whereby studies were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach within a critical realist epistemological framework. Results: Overall, 10 studies met the eligibility criteria. The 3 main themes were uses of passive sensing and AI in clinical practice, barriers to and facilitators of use in practice, and consequences for service users. A total of 5 subthemes were identified: barriers, facilitators, empowerment, risk to well-being, and data privacy and protection issues. Conclusions: Although clinicians are open-minded about the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, important factors to consider are service user well-being, clinician workloads, and therapeutic relationships. Service users and clinicians must be involved in the development of digital technologies and systems to ensure ease of use. The development of, and training in, clear policies and guidelines on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, including risk management and data security procedures, will also be key to facilitating clinician engagement. The means for clinicians and service users to provide feedback on how the use of passive sensing and AI in practice is being received should also be considered.

This survey was undertaken to identify these aspects of occupational health nurses and collect data on the topic in various countries. Methods A questionnaire was sent to prominent professionals in European countries and then to professionals in other countries. Results The study confirmed that very little is known about the number of occupational health nurses in this field. Training varies, but the more training they have, the more diversified their activities are. Conclusions This survey emphasizes the need to develop training and education for occupational health nurses so that they can efficiently help occupational health physicians and contribute towards assessing occupational risks among occupational health care workers, particularly in light of the lack of trained occupational health physicians.', 'Health care delivery in the United States has become complex and inefficient. With national health care gross domestic product and out-of-pocket expenses increasing, the nation has not yet improved the quality of health care compared with similar nations. As a result, the public asks for greater population health, improved patient experience, and reduced expenses. In this article, the author discuss how key stakeholders, including policy makers, health systems, patients, and employers, understand how these components of health care value are defined, interlink, and provide opportunities for improvement. The author also outlines concrete improvement opportunities from across the country.', 'Although a stated right for all Indians, equal access to health care in India is impeded by socioeconomic barriers. With its 3-tier system of public health care centers in villages, district hospitals, and tertiary care hospitals, government expenditure in India is inordinately low, with a disproportionate emphasis on private health spending. Accordingly, the poorest receive a minority of the available subsidies, whereas the richest obtain more than a third, fostering a divide in health care infrastructure across the rich and poor in urban and rural settings. This paradigm has implications for domestic Indian public health and global public health.', 'Aim: Our objective was to integrate lessons learned from perinatal collaborative care programs across the United States, recognizing the diversity of practice settings and patient populations, to provide guidance on successful implementation. Background: Collaborative care is a health services delivery system that integrates behavioral health care into primary care. While efficacious, effectiveness requires rigorous attention to implementation to ensure adherence to the core evidence base. Methods: Implementation strategies are divided into three pragmatic stages: preparation, program launch, and program growth and sustainment; however, these steps are non-linear and dynamic. Findings: The discussion that follows is not meant to be prescriptive; rather, all implementation tasks should be thoughtfully tailored to the unique needs and setting of the obstetric community and patient population. In particular, we are aware that implementation on the level described here assumes commitment of both effort and money on the part of clinicians, administrators, and the health system, and that such financial resources are not always available. We conclude with synthesis of a survey of existing collaborative care programs to identify implementation practices of existing programs.', \"Background. The ability to measure and improve the quality of children's health care is of national importance. Despite the existence of numerous health care quality measures, the collective ability of measures to assess children's health care quality is unclear. A review of existing health care quality measures for children is timely for both assessing the current state of quality measures for children and identifying areas requiring additional research and development. Objectives. To identify and collect current health care quality measures for child health and then to systematically categorize and classify measures and identify gaps in child health care quality measures requiring additional development. Design/Methods. We first identified child health care quality instruments with assistance from staff at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, experts in the field, the Computerized Needs-oriented Quality Measurement Evaluation System, the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, and a medical literature review. From these instruments, we then selected clinical performance measures applicable to children ( aged 0-18 years). We categorized the individual measures into the Institute of Medicine's framework for the National Health Care Quality Report. The framework includes health care quality domains ( patient safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, and timeliness) and patient-perspective domains ( staying healthy, getting better, living with illness, and end-of-life care). We then determined the balance of the measures ( how well they assess care for all children versus children with special health care needs) and their comprehensiveness ( how well the measures apply to the developmental range of children). Finally, we analyzed the ability of the measures to assess equity in care. Results. We identified 19 measure sets, and 396 individual measures were used to assess children's health care quality. The distribution of measures in the health care quality domains was: safety, 14.4%; effectiveness, 59.1%; patient-centeredness, 32.1%; and timeliness, 33.3%. The distribution of measures in the patient-perspective domains was: staying healthy, 24%; getting better, 40.2%; living with illness, 17.4%; end of life, 0%; and multidimensional, 23.5% ( measures were multidimensional if they applied to > 1 domain). Most of the measures were meant for use in the general pediatric population (81.1%), with a significant proportion designed for children with special health care needs (18.9%). The majority (greater than or equal to79%) of the measures could be applied to children across all age groups. However, there were relatively few measures designed specifically for each developmental stage. Regarding the use of measures to study equity in health care, 6 of the measure sets have been used in previous studies of equity. All the survey measure sets contain items that identify patients at risk for poor outcomes, and 4 are available in languages other than English. However, only 1 survey ( Consumer Assessment of Health Plans) has undergone studies of cross-cultural validation. Among the measure sets based on administrative data, 3 included infant mortality, a well-known measure of health disparity. Conclusions. There are several instruments designed to measure health care quality for children. Despite this, we found relatively few measures for assessing patient safety and living with illness and none for end-of-life care. Few measures are designed for specific age categories among children. Although equity is an overarching concern in health care quality, the application of current measures to assess disparities has been limited. These areas need additional research and development for a more complete assessment of health care quality for children.\", 'Patient care experience surveys evaluate the degree to which care is patient-centered. This article reviews the literature on the association between patient experiences and other measures of health care quality. Research indicates that better patient care experiences are associated with higher levels of adherence to recommended prevention and treatment processes, better clinical outcomes, better patient safety within hospitals, and less health care utilization. Patient experience measures that are collected using psychometrically sound instruments, employing recommended sample sizes and adjustment procedures, and implemented according to standard protocols are intrinsically meaningful and are appropriate complements for clinical process and outcome measures in public reporting and pay-for-performance programs.', 'Patients are not outpatients or inpatients, they are ill or healthy. Integrated Health Care provides a real chance to bring scientific innovations quickly from the laboratory to patients - and being payed for that. Although guidelines therefore are no compulsory exercise, they are tools to implement evidence-based use of innovative medical means. Health care providers should be reluctant to agree in guarantees for the success of medical therapies, since medical decisions may be influenced in different ways by that. Bureaucracy may hinder the spreading of Integrated Health Care; therefore simple regulations should be preferred. Reimbursement should not be designed according to conventional systems for outpatient or inpatient care, but as defined sums of money. That makes people sure to know what kind of contract they have agreed in.', \"Introduction: Children with special health care needs are an exponentially growing population needing integrated health care programmes that involve primary, community, hospital and tertiary care services. The aims of the study are (1) to develop and validate the Special Needs Kids Questionnaire (SpeNK-Q) designed to measure parents' perspective on continuity of care for children with special health care needs and (2) to evaluate the continuity of care based on parental experiences in this population. Methods: SpeNK-Q was derived from a previous qualitative study and was based on Haggerty's constructs of informational, management and relational continuity. Parents of preterm birth children completed the 20-item SpeNK-Q at the second or subsequent planned follow-up visit after the child's hospital discharge. Principal component analysis was used to examine the structure of the instrument. Results: Principal component analysis of 101 questionnaires administered allowed us to identify five factors explaining 60.2% of item variance: informational continuity; coordination of care; continuity of family-paediatrician relationship; family support; information on care plan. Conclusions and discussion: SpeNK-Q proved to be a psychometrically promising instrument. Its utilisation could improve the identification of areas for service development, the delivery of coordinated care and support policy makers in redesigning integrated services.\", \"China has recently emerged as an important global partner. However, like other developing nations, China has experienced dramatic demographic and epidemiologic changes in the past few decades. Population discontent with the health care system has led to major reforms. China's distinctive health care system, including its unique history, vast infrastructure, the speed of health reform, and economic capacity to make important advances in health care, nonetheless, has incomplete insurance coverage for urban and rural dwellers, uneven access, mixed quality of health care, increasing costs, and risk of catastrophic health expenditures.\", \"Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the evidence on how perceptions and/or experiences of weight bias in primary health care influence engagement with and utilization of health care services by individuals with obesity. Background: Prior studies have found discrepancies in the use of health care services by individuals living with obesity; a greater body mass index has been associated with decreased health care utilization, and weight bias has been identified as a major barrier to engagement with health services. Methods: PubMed was searched from January 2000 to July 2017. Four reviewers independently selected 21 studies examining perceptions of weight bias and its impact on engagement with primary health care services. Findings: A thematic analysis was conducted on the 21 studies that were included in this scoping review. The following 10 themes were identified: contemptuous, patronizing, and disrespectful treatment, lack of training, ambivalence, attribution of all health issues to excess weight, assumptions about weight gain, barriers to health care utilization, expectation of differential health care treatment, low trust and poor communication, avoidance or delay of health services, and 'doctor shopping'. Overall, our scoping review reveals how perceptions and/or experiences of weight bias from primary care health professionals negatively influence patient engagement with primary health care services.\", 'The purpose of this paper is to describe health profiles of adolescents in foster care. The Child Health and Illness Profile Adolescent Edition clustered adolescents in foster care into 13 mutually exclusive health profiles using dimensions of satisfaction with health, risks, resilience, and discomfort. Health profiles were further characterized into four health status rankings from best to worst health status. Many reported best health status (39%); nearly equal numbers (30.6%) had profiles indicating poor or worst health status, particularly girls and those with high risk behaviors, aggression, sexual abuse, or suicidality. It is valuable to identify health characteristics of the most vulnerable subgroups of foster youth to tailor specific interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

This present study extends prior research by examining the contribution of NHSC and non-NHSC clinicians to medical and behavioral health costs per visit. Methods: Using 2013-2017 data from 1022 federally qualified health centers merged with the NHSC participant data, we constructed multivariate linear regression models with health center and year fixed effects to examine the marginal effect of each additional NHSC and non-NHSC staff full-time equivalent (FTE) on medical and behavioral health care costs per visit in CHCs. Results: On average, each additional NHSC behavioral health staff FTE was associated with a significant reduction of 3.55 dollars of behavioral health care costs per visit in CHCs and was associated with a larger reduction of 7.95 dollars in rural CHCs specifically. In contrast, each additional non-NHSC behavioral health staff FTE did not significantly affect changes in behavioral health care costs per visit. Each additional NHSC primary care staff FTE was not significantly associated with higher medical care costs per visit, while each additional non-NHSC clinician contributed to a slight increase of $0.66 in medical care costs per visit. Conclusions: Combined with previous findings on productivity, the present findings suggest that the use of NHSC clinicians is an effective approach to improving the capacity of CHCs by increasing medical and behavioral health care visits without increasing costs of services in CHCs, including rural health centers.', \"People with serious mental illness have increased rates of physical ill-health and reduced contact with primary care services. In Australia, the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program (MHNIP) was developed to facilitate access to mental health services. However, as a primary care service, the contribution to physical health care is worthy of consideration. Thirty-eight nurses who were part of the MHNIP participated in a national survey of nurses working in mental health about physical health care. The survey invited nurses to report their views on the physical health of consumers and the regularity of physical health care they provide. Physical health-care provision in collaboration with general practitioners (GPs) and other health-care professionals was reported as common. The findings suggest that the MHNIP provides integrated care, where nurses and GPs work in collaboration, allowing enough time to discuss physical health or share physical health activities. Consumers of this service appeared to have good access to physical and mental health services, and nurses had access to primary care professionals to discuss consumers' physical health and develop their clinical skills in the physical domain. The MHNIP has an important role in addressing physical health concerns, in addition to the mental health issues of people accessing this service.\", 'The primary goal of this paper is to present an analytical framework for estimating the costs of methods designed to bridge language barriers in health care. The material presented here is written for health care administrators and public health officials who are evaluating, or who expect to evaluate, the results of analyses and published studies on the economic consequences of language programs in health cave. This paper also may be seen as providing guidelines for researchers and students interested in designing and conducting economic studies of such language programs. A taxonomy of methods that have been developed to bridge language barriers in health care is discussed. Economic principles for assessing costs of these methods then are described, as well as their potential applications by health care institutions. Last, these principles are illustrated by comparing the implementation costs of two interpretive services.', \"BackgroundIntegrated people-centred health services (IPCHS) are vital for ensuring comprehensive care towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The World Health Organisation (WHO) envisions IPCHS in delivery and access to health services. This scoping review aimed to synthesize available evidence on people-centred primary health care (PHC) and primary care.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of published literature on people-centred PHC. We searched eight databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) using search terms related to people-centred and integrated PHC/primary care services. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist to select studies. We analyzed data and generated themes using Gale's framework thematic analysis method. Themes were explained under five components of the WHO IPCHS framework.ResultsA total of fifty-two studies were included in the review; most were from high-income countries (HICs), primarily focusing on patient-centred primary care. Themes under each component of the framework included: engaging and empowering people and communities (engagement of community, empowerment and empathy); strengthening governance and accountability (organizational leadership, and mutual accountability); reorienting the model of care (residential care, care for multimorbidity, participatory care); coordinating services within and across sectors (partnership with stakeholders and sectors, and coordination of care); creating an enabling environment and funding support (flexible management for change; and enabling environment).ConclusionsSeveral people-centred PHC and primary care approaches are implemented in HICs but have little priority in low-income countries. Potential strategies for people-centred PHC could be engaging end users in delivering integrated care, ensuring accountability, and implementing a residential model of care in coordination with communities. Flexible management options could create an enabling environment for strengthening health systems to deliver people-centred PHC services.\", 'This paper focuses on the improvement of the health characteristics in European countries including the life expectancy of their inhabitants. The primary objective is to describe, compare and analyze the status and development in the Czech Republic and other countries of the European Union in terms of the key health care indicators and population health status in relation to the economy related indicators the authors have chosen. The secondary objective is to verify the hypothesis which states that the health status of the population represented by the indicator of life expectancy is closely related to the economic level of individual countries as well as to the amount of total expenditure on health care. Based on the results of the analysis we can conclude that the Czech Republic balances on the border of the group of countries with average values of indicators and the group with poorer values. The results also suggest relatively strong ties between the economic level and health status of the population represented by life expectancy.', 'IntroductionThe promotion of health literacy of the population in a situation of migration, in the community, is a fundamental field of intervention in health promotion, for the reduction of inequalities in access to health care services. It is increasingly necessary to make health care services more equitable for migrant populations. The aim of the study was to characterize the level of health literacy of the population in a migrant situation, attending a primary health care unit in the Lisbon region, to identify priority areas for community intervention that will become the focus of intervention and contribute to the increase in the health literacy levels in this population. MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out by applying the Health Literacy Survey (ILS-PT) to a sample of the population in a situation of migration, found by 27 participants. ResultsThe general health literacy index of the sample is inadequate (21.23 points). An analysis of the sub-indexes revealed that 75% of the participants had difficulties related to information about health care and 80% had difficulties in the field of health promotion. ConclusionsProblematic and inadequate levels of health literacy was significantly frequent among migrant population. So that enhancing health literacy among migrant is essential to reduce health inequalities to achieve better health outcomes and contribute to defense of human rights of this vulnerable population.', 'Objective. To assess the contents of antenatal care and to relate the findings to the adequacy of maternal health care Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Public secondary health-care facilities. Participants. Pregnant women. Interventions. Three hundred and ninety consecutive pregnant women attending 12 selected secondary health facilities were recruited proportionate to the client load recorded for each facility during the year preceding the study. Interviews were conducted using the antenatal care exit interview form of the Safe Motherhood Needs Assessment package. Main Outcome Measures. Antenatal care services provided to pregnant women in current pregnancy Results. Blood pressure measurement, abdominal palpation and detection of foetal heart rate were provided to all participants. Three hundred and eighty-six (99%) were reached with at least one educational message. One hundred and sixty-seven (42.8%) had haemoglobin or packed cell volume estimated, whereas 168 (43.1%) had urine checked for protein, at least once during antenatal visits. Routine iron and folate supplements, and malaria prophylaxis were, respectively, given to 142 (36.4%) and 25 (6.4%). Conclusions. The antenatal care service as provided had reasonable capacity for intervention against pre-eclampsia and some foetal problems, and could contribute to delivery in a health facility and by a health worker. Capacity to address the possible effects of severe anaemia and malaria in pregnancy was lacking. Equipping health-care facilities with capacity to detect anaemia and proteinuria as well as ensuring that iron and folate supplements, and malaria prophylaxis are given to all pregnant women would help to meet national guidelines and improve quality of service.', \"Breast cancer diagnosis was used as a frame for identification of the complex health care requirements. Modem health care trends in patients with breast carcinoma as well as a constant search for improvements have the implementation of health care principles for every individual patient as their goal. Breast carcinoma is not a single trauma, but a long-term and multiple trauma with stressor varying in its intensity and nature. It requests a continual medical treatment, controls, and health care in all the stages of the disease and all the therapy modalities. The opinion that the patients should actively participate in planning and realization of the activities contributes to the fact that they take over a part of responsibility during surgical, chemo and radiotherapeutic treatment, as well as during the rehabilitation process. The quality of life includes the concepts of physical health, psychological and spiritual interest, family relations, social and economic status, health care principles in patients with breast carcinoma improve the quality of life of such patients with good cooperation, connectivity and communication of the patient, members of the medical team and the members of the patient's family.\", \"Objectives: To examine utilisation of primary health care services (subsidised by the Australian Government, Medicare Benefits Schedule, MBS) before and after entry into long-term care (LTC) in Australia.Methods: A retrospective cohort study of older people (aged >= 65 years) who entered LTC in Australia between 2012 and 2016 using the Historical Cohort of the Registry of Senior Australians. MBS-subsidised general attendances (general practitioner (GP), medical and nurse practitioners), health assessment and management plans, allied health, mental health services and selected specialist attendances accessed in 91-day periods 12 months before and after LTC entry were examined. Adjusted relative changes in utilisation 0-3 months before and after LTC entry were estimated using risk ratios (RR) calculated using Generalised Estimating Equation Poisson models.Results: 235,217 residents were included in the study with a median age of 84 years (interquartile range 79-89) and 61.1% female. In the first 3 months following LTC entry, GP / medical practitioner attendances increased from 86.6% to 95.6% (aRR 1.10 95%CI 1.10-1.11), GP / medical practitioner urgent after hours (from 12.3% to 21.1%; aRR 1.72, 95%CI 1.70-1.74) and after-hours attendances (from 18.5% to 33.8%; aRR 1.83, 95%CI 1.81-1.84) increased almost two-fold. Pain, palliative and geriatric specialist medicine attendances were low in the 3 months prior (<3%) and decreased further following LTC admission.Conclusion: There is an opportunity to improve the utilisation of primary health care services following LTC entry to ensure that residents' increasingly complex care needs are adequately met.\", 'ObjectiveTo evaluate the impacts of a transition to an integrated managed care model, wherein Medicaid managed care organizations moved from a carve-out model to a carve-in model integrating the financing of behavioral and physical health care. Data Sources/Study SettingMedicaid claims data from Washington State, 2014-2019, supplemented with structured interviews with key stakeholders. Study DesignThis mixed-methods study used difference-in-differences models to compare changes in two counties that transitioned to financial integration in 2016 to 10 comparison counties maintaining carve-out models, combined with qualitative analyses of 15 key informant interviews. Quantitative outcomes included binary measures of access to outpatient mental health care, primary care, the emergency department (ED), and inpatient care for mental health conditions. Data CollectionMedicaid claims were collected administratively, and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Principal FindingsThe transition to financially integrated care was initially disruptive for behavioral health providers and was associated with a temporary decline in access to outpatient mental health services among enrollees with serious mental illness (SMI), but there were no statistically significant or sustained differences after the first year. Enrollees with SMI also experienced a slight increase in access to primary care (1.8%, 95% CI 1.0%-2.6%), but no sustained statistically significant changes in the use of ED or inpatient services for mental health care. The transition to financially integrated care had relatively little impact on primary care providers, with few changes for enrollees with mild, moderate, or no mental illness. ConclusionsFinancial integration of behavioral and physical health in Medicaid managed care did not appear to drive clinical transformation and was disruptive to behavioral health providers. States moving towards carve-in models may need to incorporate support for practice transformation or financial incentives to achieve the benefits of coordinated mental and physical health care.', 'Background The role of socioeconomic factors as determinants of oncology consultations for advanced cancers in public payer health care systems is unknown. This study examined the association between material deprivation and receipt of cancer care among patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Methods This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of noncuratively treated patients with GI cancer diagnosed from 2007 to 2017. Material deprivation, representing income, quality of housing, education, and family structure, was defined as quintiles on the basis of 2016 census data. The first consultation with a radiation oncologist or medical oncologist and the receipt of 1 or more instances of radiation and/or chemotherapy were measured in the year after diagnosis. Adjusted, cause-specific Cox proportional hazards competing risk analyses were used (competing event = death). Results This study included 34,022 noncuratively treated patients with GI cancer. Consultation rates ranged from 67.8% for those in the most materially deprived communities to 73.5% for those in the least materially deprived communities. Among those with a consult, rates of cancer-directed therapy ranged from 58.5% for patients in the most materially deprived communities to 62.3% for patients in the least materially deprived communities. Patients living in the most materially deprived communities were significantly less likely to see a radiation and/or medical oncologist after a diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.92) and significantly less likely to receive radiation and/or chemotherapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76-0.85) than those living in the least materially deprived communities. Conclusions This study identified socioeconomic disparities in accessing cancer care. Continued efforts at examining and developing evidence-based policies for interventions that begin before or at the time of oncologist consultation are required to address root causes of inequities.', 'Aim: This study aimed to identify and reach consensus among primary health care participants [registered nurses (RNs) who receive clients, directors of nursing, senior physicians, health promotion officers, and local councillors] on the types of service provider that RNs who receive clients represent in the implementation of health promotion practices in primary health care in Eastern Finland. Background: There is an increasing focus on public health thinking in many countries as the population ages. To meet the growing needs of the health promotion practices of populations, advance practice has been recognized as effective in the primary health care setting. The advance practice nurses share many common features, such as being RNs with additional education, possessing competencies to work independently, treating clients in both acute and primary care settings, and applying a variety of health promotion practices into nursing. Methods: The two-stage modified Delphi method was applied. In round one, semi-structured interviews were conducted among primary health care participants (n = 42) in 11 health centres in Eastern Finland. In round two, a questionnaire survey was conducted in the same health centres. The questionnaire was answered by 64% of those surveyed (n = 56). For data analysis, content analysis and descriptive statistics were used. Findings: This study resulted in four types of service provider that RNs who receive clients represented in the implementation of health promotion practices in the primary health care setting in Eastern Finland. First, the client-oriented health promoter demonstrated four dimensions, which reached consensus levels ranging between 82.1 and 89.3%. Second, the developer of health promotion practices comprised four dimensions, which reached consensus levels between 71.4 and 85.7%. Third, the member of multi-professional teams of health promotion practices representing three dimensions, with consensus levels between 69.6 and 82.1%. Fourth, the type who showed interest towards health policy reached a consensus level of 55.4% in this study.', 'Background: Health system weaknesses in Africa are broadly well known, constraining progress on reducing the burden of both communicable and non-communicable disease (Afr Health Monitor, Special issue, 2011, 14-24), and the key challenges in leadership, governance, health workforce, medical products, vaccines and technologies, information, finance and service delivery have been well described (Int Arch Med, 2008, 1: 27). This paper uses focus group methodology to explore health worker perspectives on the challenges posed to integration of mental health into primary care by generic health system weakness. Methods: Two ninety minute focus groups were conducted in Nyanza province, a poor agricultural region of Kenya, with 20 health workers drawn from a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a mental health training programme for primary care, 10 from the intervention group clinics where staff had received the training programme, and 10 health workers from the control group where staff had not received the training). Results: These focus group discussions suggested that there are a number of generic health system weaknesses in Kenya which impact on the ability of health workers to care for clients with mental health problems and to implement new skills acquired during a mental health continuing professional development training programmes. These weaknesses include the medicine supply, health management information system, district level supervision to primary care clinics, the lack of attention to mental health in the national health sector targets, and especially its absence in district level targets, which results in the exclusion of mental health from such district level supervision as exists, and the lack of awareness in the district management team about mental health. The lack of mental health coverage included in HIV training courses experienced by the health workers was also striking, as was the intensive focus during district supervision on HIV to the detriment of other health issues. Conclusion: Generic health system weaknesses in Kenya impact on efforts for horizontal integration of mental health into routine primary care practice, and greatly frustrate health worker efforts. Improvement of medicine supplies, information systems, explicit inclusion of mental health in district level targets, management and supervision to primary care are likely to greatly improve primary care health worker effectiveness, and enable training programmes to be followed by better use in the field of newly acquired skills. A major lever for horizontal integration of mental health into the health system would be the inclusion of mental health in the national health sector reform strategy at community, primary care and district levels rather than just at the higher provincial and national levels, so that supportive supervision from the district level to primary care would become routine practice rather than very scarce activity.', \"Background: Health financing and delivery reforms designed to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) need to be informed by an understanding of factors that both promote access to health care and undermine it. This study examines the level of health care utilisation in Timor-Leste and the factors that drive it. Methods: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of health care utilisation in 1712 households were used to develop multilevel models exploring how need and predisposing and enabling factors explain health care utilisation at both primary and secondary care facilities. Results: Need was found to be the key driver in seeking both primary care and hospital services. Rural households were less likely to go to hospital (odds ratio 0.7) than urban households. The poorest quintile was also less likely to use more expensive hospital services than other socio-economic groups. Conclusions: Understanding the determinants of seeking health care in Timor-Leste is of considerable policy significance, because health care is free at the point of use. Our findings indicate that the public resources for health care are subsidising the rich more than the poor. Health care reforms in Timor-Leste need to reduce the 'other' costs of health care, such as distance barriers, to address these inequities.\", 'To determine if prior use of health services predicts subsequent risk of unemployment and to describe the acute effects of exposure to unemployment on the use of health care services. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 18,272 employed and 1,498 unemployed individuals in a Canadian province in 1986. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause and cause-specific rates of hospital admission and ambulatory physician contacts over the period 1983-89 were compared between unemployed and employed individuals across four consecutive time periods related to the onset of unemployment. RESULTS: Adjusted rates of hospitalisation admission and physician contacts were higher among the unemployed across all four periods. When persons with a history of mental health treatment were excluded, health care use in the period prior to the onset of unemployment was equivalent among the employed and unemployed. Controlling for mental health treatment history, all-cause and cause-specific health care use was elevated among the unemployed during the unemployment spell. CONCLUSIONS: Unemployed individuals had increased hospitalisation rates before their current spell of unemployment. Much of this difference is due to the subgroup with prior mental health treatment. For individuals without prior mental health care, hospitalisation increased following a period of unemployment.', 'ObjectiveTo assess the impact of the Health Care Homes (HCH) primary health care initiative on quality of care and patient outcomes.Design, settingQuasi-experimental, matched cohort study; analysis of general practice data extracts and linked administrative data from ten Australian primary health networks, 1 October 2017 - 30 June 2021.ParticipantsPeople with chronic health conditions (practice data extracts: 9811; linked administrative data: 10 682) enrolled in the HCH 1 October 2017 - 30 June 2019; comparison groups of patients receiving usual care (1:1 propensity score-matched).InterventionParticipants were involved in shared care planning, provided enhanced access to team care, and encouraged to seek chronic condition care at the HCH practice where they were enrolled. Participating practices received bundled payments based on clinical risk tier.Main outcome measuresAccess to care, processes of care, diabetes-related outcomes, hospital service use, risk of death.ResultsDuring the first twelve months after enrolment, the mean numbers of general practitioner encounters (rate ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.17) and Medicare Benefits Schedule claims for allied health services (rate ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33) were higher for the HCH than the usual care group. Annual influenza vaccinations (relative risk, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.22) and measurements of blood pressure (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11), blood lipids (relative risk, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.21), glycated haemoglobin (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08), and kidney function (relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11-1.15) were more likely in the HCH than the usual care group during the twelve months after enrolment. Similar rate ratios and relative risks applied in the second year. The numbers of emergency department presentations (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18) and emergency admissions (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22) were higher for the HCH group during the first year; other differences in hospital use were not statistically significant. Differences in glycaemic and blood pressure control in people with diabetes in the second year were not statistically significant. By 30 June 2021, 689 people in the HCH group (6.5%) and 646 in the usual care group (6.1%) had died (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96-1.20).ConclusionsThe HCH program was associated with greater access to care and improved processes of care for people with chronic diseases, but not changes in diabetes-related outcomes, most measures of hospital use, or risk of death.', 'Aim. To describe health care reforms and analyze the transition of the health care system in Romania in the 1989-2001 period. Method. We analyzed policy documents, political intentions and objectives of health care reform, described new legislation, and presented changes in financial resources of the health care system. Results. The reforms of the health care system in Romania have been realized in a rather difficult context of scarcity of financial and human resources. The Gross Domestic Product spent on health care in 2000 was 4% and the number of physicians in 1999 was 42,975. The main changes due to the legislative reforms have been the introduction of a new social health insurance and strengthening of the position of family physicians. Negative effects of the reforms have been the decrease in health care accessibility and growing inequity in utilization of health care services. Health care users still pay physicians under-the-table, and have more out-of-pocket health care expenses. Conclusion. Future reforms in Romania should encourage the positive effects of current reforms: free choice of physician, autonomy of the primary health care system, and increasing financial resources for the health care system.', \"Being a family member of a patient who is being treated in an acute care setting for cancer often involves a number of challenges. Our study describes Norwegian cancer care health professionals' perceptions of family members who served as family caregivers (FCs) and their need for support during the in-hospital cancer treatment of their ill family member. Focus group discussions were conducted with a multidisciplinary team of 24 experienced social workers, physicians, and nurses who were closely involved in the patients' in-hospital cancer treatment and care. Drawing on qualitative hermeneutic analysis, four main themes describe health professionals' perceptions of FCs during the patient's in-hospital cancer care: an asset and additional burden, infinitely strong and struggling with helplessness, being an outsider in the center of care, and being in different temporalities. We conclude that it is a challenge for health care professionals to support the family and create room for FC's needs in acute cancer care. System changes are needed in health care, so that the patient/FC dyad is viewed as a unit of care in a dual process of caregiving, which would enable FCs to be given space and inclusion in care, with their own needs simultaneously considered alongside those of the patient.\", 'In Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa, health care financing is progressive overall. However, out-of-pocket payments and health insurance for the informal sector are regressive. The distribution of health care benefits is generally pro-rich. This paper explores the factors influencing these distributions in the three countries. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with insurance scheme members, the uninsured, health care providers and managers. Household surveys were also conducted in all countries. Flat-rate contributions contributed to the regressivity of informal sector voluntary schemes, either by design (in Tanzania) or due to difficulties in identifying household income levels (in Ghana). In all three countries, the regressivity of out-of-pocket payments is due to the incomplete enforcement of exemption and waiver policies, partial or no insurance cover among poorer segments of the population and limited understanding of entitlements among these groups. Generally, the pro-rich distribution of benefits is due to limited access to higher level facilities among poor and rural populations, who rely on public primary care facilities and private pharmacies. Barriers to accessing health care include medical and transport costs, exacerbated by the lack of comprehensive insurance coverage among poorer groups. Service availability problems, including frequent drug stock-outs, limited or no diagnostic equipment, unpredictable opening hours and insufficient skilled staff also limit service access. Poor staff attitudes and lack of confidence in the skills of health workers were found to be important barriers to access. Financing reforms should therefore not only consider how to generate funds for health care, but also explicitly address the full range of affordability, availability and acceptability barriers to access in order to achieve equitable financing and benefit incidence patterns.', \"Background According to the World Health Organization, palliative care is one of the main components of healthcare. As the incidence of cancer is increasing in the world, home-based palliative care can be beneficial for many patients. This study was designed to explore health care providers' perceptions about home-based palliative care in terminally ill cancer patients. Methods This qualitative study was carried out using the conventional content analysis from October 2016 to September 2018 in Iran. Participants were home care providers who were selected using purposive sampling. The data were collected through 18 individual interviews, and a focus group meeting. Data were analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results from the data analysis, 511 initial codes were extracted, which were categorized into the two main categories of challenges and opportunities for home-based palliative care and 10 subcategories. The subcategories of challenges included deficiencies in inter-sectoral and inter-professional cooperation, lack of infrastructures for end-of-life care, challenges related to the management of death, challenges of transferring patients to home, providing non-academic palliative care, lack of political commitment of the government and Spiritual vacuum. The category of opportunities included subcategories of cost-effectiveness, moving towards socializing health, and structure of the health system. Conclusions Home-based palliative care requires government and health system support. Structural and process modification in the healthcare can provide conditions in which terminally ill cancer patients receive appropriate care in home and experience death with dignity through support of family, friends and healthcare.\", 'This paper describes models and strategies currently used in various health care settings around the country to improve health cave access for limited English-proficient (LEP) individuals and examines a spectrum of strategies that overcome barriers to care, including the use of bilingual providers, bilingual/bicultural community health workers, professional and nonprofessional interpreters, the role of written translations, and new approaches to interpretation that use technological advances. The paper also considers how these strategies are applied in a variety of health care organizations, such as community health centers, public health departments, hospitals, and managed care organizations. Specific examples of model programs and strategies in each of these health care settings are described. Finally, recommendations ave reviewed that may assist institutions in improving the provision of health care for LEP populations.', 'The aim of this study was to assess: (1) the proportion of youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) with adequate transition preparation, (2) whether transition preparation differs by individual, condition-related and health care system-related factors, and (3) whether specific components of the medical home are associated with adequate transition preparation. The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 17,114 parents of YSHCN ages 12 to 18 years. Adequate transition preparation was based on positive responses to questions about transition to an adult provider, changing health care needs, maintaining insurance coverage, and if providers encouraged YSHCN to take responsibility for health care needs. Weighted descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between patient and health care system factors and adequate transition preparation. Overall, 32.1% of YSHCN had adequate transition preparation. Older age, female sex, income <= 400% of the poverty level, lack of medical complexity, and having shared decision making, family-centered care, and effective care coordination were associated with increased odds of transition preparation. The majority of YSHCN do not receive adequate transition preparation and younger, male adolescents with medical complexity were less likely to receive transition preparation. Different patterns of disparities were identified for each subcomponent measure of transition preparation, which may help target at-risk populations for specific services. Efforts to improve transition preparation should leverage specific components of the medical home including care coordination, shared decision making, and family-centered care.', 'ObjectiveThis study aimed to look at the practices and perspectives of residential aged care facility (RACF) care staff regarding the provision of oral health care in RACFs. BackgroundEmphasis has been placed on the provision of adequate oral health care in RACFs through the Better Oral Health in Residential Aged Care programme. Endorsed by the Australian government, this programme provided oral health education and training for aged care staff. However, recent evidence suggests that nearly five years after the implementation of this programme, the provision of oral care in RACFs in NSW remains inadequate. Materials and MethodsThis project utilised an exploratory qualitative design which involved a focus group with 12 RACF care staff. Participants were asked to discuss the current oral health practices in their facility, and their perceived barriers to providing oral health care. ResultsThe key findings demonstrated current oral health practices and challenges among care staff. Most care staff had received oral health training and demonstrated positive attitudes towards providing dental care. However, some participants identified that ongoing and regular training was necessary to inform practice and raise awareness among residents. Organisational constraints and access to dental services also limited provision of dental care while a lack of standardised guidelines created confusion in defining their role as oral healthcare providers in the RACF. ConclusionThis study highlighted the need for research and strategies that focus on capacity building care staff in oral health care and improving access of aged care residents to dental services.', 'Skyrocketing health care costs are burdening our people and our economy, yet health care indicators show how little we are achieving with the money we spend. Federal and state governments, along with public-health experts and policymakers, are proposing a host of new initiatives to find solutions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is designed to address both the quality and accessibility of health care, while reducing its cost. This article provides an overview of models supported by the Affordable Care Act that address one or more goals of the Triple Aim: better health care for individuals, better health outcomes in the community, and lower health care costs. The models described below rely on the core principles of primary care: comprehensive, coordinated and continuous primary care; preventive care; and the sophisticated implementation of health information technology designed to promote communication between health care providers, enhance coordination of care, minimize duplication of services, and permit reporting on quality. These models will support better health care and reduced costs for people who access health care services but will not address health outcomes in the community at large. Health care professionals, working in concert with community-based organizations and advocates, must also address conditions that influence health in the broadest sense to truly improve the health of our communities and reduce health care costs. Mt Sinai J Med 79:527534, 2012. (c) 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine', 'Background: Almost all studies of post-acute care (PAC) focus on older persons, frequently those suffering from chronic health problems. Some research is available on PAC for the pediatric population in general. However, very few studies focus on PAC services for children with special health care needs (SHCN). Objective: To investigate factors affecting the provision of PAC to children with SHCN. Methods: Pooled cross-sectional data from Texas Department of State Health Services hospital discharge database from 2011-2014 were analyzed. Publicly available algorithms identified chronic conditions, complex chronic conditions, and the principal problem leading to hospitalization. Analysis involved estimating two logistic regressions, with clustered robust standard errors, concerning the likelihood of receiving PAC and where that PAC was delivered. Models included patient characteristics and conditions, as well as hospital characteristics and location. Results: Only 5.8 percent of discharges for children with SHCN resulted in the provision of PAC. Two-thirds of PAC was provided in a health care facility (HCF). Severity of illness and the number of complex chronic conditions, though not the number of chronic problems, made PAC more likely. Patient demographics had no effect on PAC decisions. Hospital type and location also affected PAC decision-making. Conclusions: PAC was provided to relatively few children with SHCN, which raises questions concerning the potential underutilization of PAC for children with SHCN. Also, the provision of most PAC in a HCF (66%) seems at odds with professional judgment and family preferences indicating that health care for children with SHCN is best provided in the home. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.', 'Integrated care is expected to improve patient experience, patient outcomes and assist with the increasing demand on health services from those with long term conditions including mental disorder. Few studies have evaluated health care utilization as a consequence of increased integration of mental health care. This study considers the factors known to influence secondary health service utilization and investigated the impact of a locality based mental health integrated model of care (ILoC) providing specialist consultation and liaison advice to primary care, to support early diagnosis and treatment. Using existing hospital databases, the study-cohort was identified (service users supported by ILoC, and then referred within 6 months to specialist mental health services (MHS) care between 2017- 2018) and compared on health services utilization with a matched-cohort (without ILoC support before referral to specialist services). The length-of-care in the non-acute MHS was 71% shorter for the ILoC study-cohort, and differences increased in the subgroup taking antidepressants. The ILoC study-cohort was less likely to be admitted to acute MHS on first referral post ILoC intervention and had a 25% lower relative risk of acute MHS admissions at any time in follow-up. There was no difference in the average MHS inpatient length-of-stay. The risk of general hospital acute inpatient admission was marginally higher in the ILoC study-cohort. Conclusions: ILoC appears to shorten non-acute length-of-specialist-care and reduce acute mental health admission. The study provides a first step in understanding the clinical characteristics and specialist services health-care utilization of patients supported by an integrated mental care approach.', \"BackgroundChildren in the UK care system often face multiple disadvantages in terms of health, education and future employment. This is especially true of mental health where they present with greater mental health needs than other children. Although transition from care - the process of leaving the local authority as a child-in-care to independence - is a key juncture for young people, it is often experienced negatively with inconsistency in care and exacerbation of existing mental illness. Those receiving support from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), often experience an additional, concurrent transfer to adult services (AMHS), which are guided by different service models which can create a care gap between services. MethodThis qualitative study explored care-leavers' experiences of mental illness, and transition in social care and mental health services. Twelve care-leavers with mental health needs were interviewed and data analysed using framework analysis. ResultsSixteen individual themes were grouped into four superordinate themes: overarching attitudes towards the care journey, experience of social care, experience of mental health services and recommendations. ConclusionsExisting social care and mental health teams can improve the care of care-leavers navigating multiple personal, practical and service transitions. Recommendations include effective Pathway Planning, multiagency coordination, and stating who is responsible for mental health care and its coordination. Participants asked that youth mental health services span the social care transition; and provide continuity of mental health provision when care-leavers are at risk of feeling abandoned and isolated, suffering deteriorating mental health and struggling to establish new relationships with professionals. Young people say that the key to successful transition and achieving independence is maintaining trust and support from services.\", 'PurposeThis study compares the perspectives of rural and urban mental health clinicians working in various Washington State Community Health Centers that have implemented an integrated primary care/mental health program. MethodsWe conducted a Web-based survey of mental health clinicians (n = 71) who work in an integrated primary care/mental health program (the program) in 1 of 150 safety net primary care clinics in Washington State. Most participating clinics are Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health Clinics. Pooled survey results from clinicians working in rural settings were compared to those working in urban settings. Semistructured interviews were conducted with a subset (n = 32) of survey respondents. Comments made during these interviews were analyzed for themes. FindingsIn the survey phase, both rural and urban clinicians generally agreed that the program benefitted their patients. Rural respondents were particularly appreciative of the flexibility that the program offered when planning care. Not surprisingly, social service limitations (such as housing or transportation services) were more often mentioned as program limitations. Rural clinicians were more likely to note a lack of awareness of program resources among other medical providers on the team. ConclusionsClinicians working in rural primary care clinics value the availability and flexibility of an integrated primary care/mental health program as an option for providing mental health care for their patients. Clinicians working in rural settings could benefit from additional training and program implementation support to best meet the needs of their patients.', \"Background Self-rated health (SRH) is a single-item measure of current health, which is often used in community surveys and has been associated with various objective health outcomes. The prevalence and factors associated with SRH in Sub-Saharan Africa remain largely unknown. This study sought to investigate: (1) the prevalence of poor SRH, (2) possible associations between SRH, and socio-demographic and clinical parameters, and (3) associations between SRH and the patients' assessment of the quality of primary care. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 primary care facilities in Blantyre, Neno, and Thyolo districts of Malawi among 962 participants who sought care in these facilities. An interviewer-administered questionnaire containing the Malawian primary care assessment tool, and questions on socio-demographic characteristics and self-rated health was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the distribution of variables of interest and binary logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with poor SRH. Results Poor SRH was associated with female sex, increasing age, decreasing education, frequent health care attendance, and with reported disability. Patients content with the service provided and who reported higher scores of relational continuity from their health care providers reported better SRH as compared with others. Conclusion This study reports findings from a context where SRH is scarcely examined. The prevalence of poor SRH in Malawi is in line with findings from clinical populations in other countries. The associations between poor SRH and socio-demographic factors are also known from other populations. SRH might be improved by emphasizing continuity of care in primary care services.\", \"Nearly 750 000 children are currently in foster care in the United States. Recent trends in foster care include reliance on extended family members to care for children in kinship care placements, increased efforts to reduce the length of placement, acceleration of termination of parental rights proceedings, and emphasis on adoption. It is not clear what impact welfare reform may have on the number of children who may require foster care placement. Although most children enter foster care with medical, mental health, or developmental problems, many do not receive adequate or appropriate care while in placement. Psychological and emotional problems, in particular, may worsen rather than improve. Multiple barriers to adequate health care for this population exist. Health care practitioners can help to improve the health and well-being of children in foster care by performing timely and thorough admission evaluations, providing continuity of care, and playing an active advocacy role. Potential areas for health services research include study of the impact of different models of health care delivery, the role of a medical home in providing continuity of care, the perception of the foster care experience by the child, children's adjustment to foster care, and foster parent education on health outcomes.\", 'Provisions of the Affordable Care Act provide unprecedented opportunities for expanded access to behavioral health care and for redesigning the provision of services. Key to these reforms is establishing mental and substance abuse care as essential coverage, extending Medicaid eligibility and insurance parity, and protecting insurance coverage for persons with preexisting conditions and disabilities. Many provisions, including Accountable Care Organizations, health homes, and other structures, provide incentives for integrating primary care and behavioral health services and coordinating the range of services often required by persons with severe and persistent mental health conditions. Careful research and experience are required to establish the services most appropriate for primary care and effective linkage to specialty mental health services. Research providing guidance on present evidence and uncertainties is reviewed. Success in redesign will follow progress building on collaborative care and other evidence-based practices, reshaping professional incentives and practices, and reinvigorating the behavioral health workforce.', 'Primary care remains the main setting for delivery of psychiatric care. An integrated approach improves the ability of primary care providers (PCPs) to care for complex patients with behavioral health needs. This article describes integrated care and how physician associates/assistants can gain additional training to become behavioral health specialists.', 'Strengthening primary health care (PHC) is considered a priority for efficient and responsive health systems, but empirical evidence from low-and middle-income countries is limited. The stepwise introduction of family medicine across all 81 provinces of Turkey (a middle-income country) between 2005 and 2010, aimed at PHC strengthening, presents a natural experiment for assessing the effect of family medicine on health service utilization and user satisfaction. The effect of health system reforms, that introduced family medicine, on utilization was assessed using longitudinal, province-level data for 12 years and multivariate regression models adjusting for supply-side variables, demographics, socio-economic development and underlying yearly trends. User satisfaction with primary and secondary care services was explored using data from annual Life Satisfaction Surveys. Trends in preferred first point of contact (primary vs secondary, public vs. private), reason for choice and health services issues, were described and stratified by patient characteristics, provider type, and rural/urban settings. Between 2002 and 2013, the average number of PHC consultations increased from 1.75 to 2.83 per person per year. In multivariate models, family medicine introduction was associated with an increase of 0.37 PHC consultations per person (P<0.001), and slower annual growth in PHC and secondary care consultations. Following family medicine introduction, the growth of PHC and secondary care consultations per person was 0.08 and 0.30, respectively, a year. PHC increased as preferred provider by 9.5% over 7 years with the reasons of proximity and service satisfaction, which increased by 14.9% and 11.8%, respectively. Reporting of poor facility hygiene, difficulty getting an appointment, poor physician behaviour and high costs of health care all declined (P<0.001) in PHC settings, but remained higher among urban, low-income and working-age populations.', 'Integrated Health Care may possibly be a training field for efficient patient and case mangement between different providers involved. In the medium term, those instruments should be developed further so that they are no longer merely tools for cost containment, risk transfer to the providers side and competition for the good risks in health care. In the present state Integrated Health Care - as many other new regulations - means a displacement of money from health care to administration. All participants are urged to check their contracts that the benefit for patients exceeds the price of the paper.', \"Background Primary health care is a critical foundation of high-quality health systems. Health facility management has been studied in high-income countries, but there are significant measurement gaps about facility management and primary health care performance in low and middle-income countries. A primary health care facility management evaluation tool (PRIME-Tool) was initially piloted in Ghana where better facility management was associated with higher performance on select primary health care outcomes such as essential drug availability, trust in providers, ease of following a provider's advice, and overall patient-reported quality rating. In this study, we sought to understand health facility management within Uganda's decentralized primary health care system. Methods We administered and analyzed a cross-sectional household and health facility survey conducted in Uganda in 2019, assessing facility management using the PRIME-Tool. Results Better facility management was associated with better essential drug availability but not better performance on measures of stocking equipment. Facilities with better PRIME-Tool management scores trended towards better performance on a number of experiential quality measures. We found significant disparities in the management performance of primary health care facilities. In particular, patients with greater wealth and education and those living in urban areas sought care at facilities that performed better on management. Private facilities and hospitals performed better on the management index than public facilities and health centers and clinics. Conclusions These results suggest that investments in stronger facility management in Uganda may strengthen key aspects of facility readiness such as essential drug availability and potentially could affect experiential quality of care. Nevertheless, the stark disparities demonstrate that Uganda policymakers need to target investments strategically in order to improve primary health care equitably across socioeconomic status and geography. Moreover, other low and middle-income countries may benefit from the use of the PRIME-Tool to rapidly assess facility management with the goal of understanding and improving primary health care performance.\", \"Background: Hospital HIV care and public sexual health care (a Sexual Health Care Centre) services were integrated to provide sexual health counselling and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing and treatment (sexual health care) to larger numbers of HIV patients. Services, need and usage were assessed using a patient perspective, which is a key factor for the success of service integration. Methods: The study design was a one-group pre-test and post-test comparison of 447 HIV-infected heterosexual individuals and men who have sex with men (MSM) attending a hospital-based HIV centre serving the southern region of the Netherlands. The intervention offered comprehensive sexual health care using an integrated care approach. The main outcomes were intervention uptake, patients' pre-test care needs (n=254), and quality rating. Results: Pre intervention, 43% of the patients wanted to discuss sexual health (51% MSM; 30% heterosexuals). Of these patients, 12% to 35% reported regular coverage, and up to 25% never discussed sexual health topics at their HIV care visits. Of the patients, 24% used our intervention. Usage was higher among patients who previously expressed a need to discuss sexual health. Most patients who used the integrated services were new users of public health services. STIs were detected in 13% of MSM and in none of the heterosexuals. The quality of care was rated good. Conclusions: The HIV patients in our study generally considered sexual health important, but the regular counselling and testing at the HIV care visit was insufficient. The integration of public health and hospital services benefited both care sectors and their patients by addressing sexual health questions, detecting STIs, and conducting partner notification. Successful sexual health care uptake requires increased awareness among patients about their care options as well as a cultural shift among care providers.\", 'In light of increasing interest in evidence-based management, we conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) to determine the availability and accessibility of evidence for health care managers; 14 MAs and 61 SRs met the inclusion criteria. Most reviews appeared in medical journals (53%), originated in the United States (29%) or United Kingdom (22%), were hospital-based (55%), and targeted clinical providers (55%). Topics included health services organization (34%), quality/patient safety (17%), information technology (15%), organization/workplace management (13%), and health care workforce (12%). Most reviews addressed clinical topics of relevance to managers; management-related interventions were rare. The management issues were mostly classified as operational (65%). Surprisingly, 96.5% of search results were not on target. A better classification within PubMed is needed to increase the accessibility of meaningful resources and facilitate evidence retrieval. Health care journals should take initiatives encouraging the publication of reviews in relevant management areas.', 'Background: Smoking, poor nutrition, risky alcohol use, and physical inactivity are the primary behavioral risks for common causes of mortality and morbidity. Evidence and guidelines support routine clinician delivery of preventive care. Limited evidence describes the level delivered in community health settings. The objective was to determine the: prevalence of preventive care provided by community health clinicians; association between client and service characteristics and receipt of care; and acceptability of care. This will assist in informing interventions that facilitate adoption of opportunistic preventive care delivery to all clients. Methods: In 2009 and 2010 a telephone survey was undertaken of 1284 clients across a network of 56 public community health facilities in one health district in New South Wales, Australia. The survey assessed receipt of preventive care (assessment, brief advice, and referral/follow-up) regarding smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol overconsumption, and physical inactivity; and acceptability of care. Results: Care was most frequently reported for smoking (assessment: 59.9%, brief advice: 61.7%, and offer of referral to a telephone service: 4.5%) and least frequently for inadequate fruit or vegetable consumption (27.0%, 20.0% and 0.9% respectively). Sixteen percent reported assessment for all risks, 16.2% received brief advice for all risks, and 0.6% were offered a specific referral for all risks. The following were associated with increased care: diabetes services, number of appointments, being male, Aboriginal, unemployed, and socio-economically disadvantaged. Acceptability of preventive care was high (76.0%-95.3%). Conclusions: Despite strong client support, preventive care was not provided opportunistically to all, and was preferentially provided to select groups. This suggests a need for practice change strategies to enhance preventive care provision to achieve adherence to clinical guidelines.', 'Objective. To study the prevalence and possible predictors for smoking during pregnancy in Iceland. Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. Twenty-six primary health care centres in Iceland 2009 - 2010. Subjects. Women attending antenatal care in the 11th - 16th week of pregnancy were invited to participate by convenient consecutive manner, stratified according to residency. A total of 1111 women provided data in this first phase of the cohort study. Main outcome measures. Smoking habits before and during early pregnancy were assessed with a postal questionnaire, which also included questions about socio-demographic background, physical and emotional well-being, and use of medications. Results. The prevalence of smoking prior to pregnancy was 20% (223/1111). During early pregnancy, it was 5% (53/1111). In comparison with women who stopped smoking during early pregnancy, those who continued to smoke had on average a significantly lower level of education, had smoked more cigarettes per day before pregnancy, and were more likely to use nicotine replacement therapy in addition to smoking during pregnancy. A higher number of cigarettes consumed per day before pregnancy and a lower level of education were the strongest predictors for continued smoking during pregnancy. Conclusion. The majority of Icelandic women who smoke stop when they become pregnant, and the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Iceland is still about 5%. Our results indicate stronger nicotine dependence in women who do not stop smoking during pregnancy. Awareness of this can help general practitioners (GPs) and others providing antenatal care to approach these women with more insight and empathy, which might theoretically help them to quit.', 'In Norway, the Directorate of Health is responsible for two nationwide registries - the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and the Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care (NRPHC) - which together cover all governmental-funded health care. The NPR (specialist health care) was established in 2008, while the NRPHC (primary health care) was established in 2017. Data from the NPR are extensively used in a large variety of studies. We expect that data from the NRPHC will increase in importance when the registry covers a longer time period. The NRPHC will be especially important for studying conditions mainly treated in primary care and for investigation of patient trajectories. The main aim of this paper is to give an overview of the history and content of the NPR and its research possibilities. In addition, we introduce the NRPHC as a possible future research tool and the potential for studying patient trajectories when combining data from the two registries.', 'Introduction: Designing systematic, scientifically rigorous program evaluations ( PE) is 1 way to contribute to the significant need to build best practices and a stronger evidence base for integrated behavioral health care. However, there are many potential pitfalls when conducting PE in real-world settings, and many clinicians and administrators may be hesitant to engage in PE due to lack of training or resources. Rigorous PE can be achieved feasibly and efficiently. Method: This article discusses common challenges that arise when conducting PE in integrated behavioral health care settings and illustrates ways to increase the methodological quality of PE efforts using lessons learned from 2 real-world case examples. The first example included a PE of a training program for brief alcohol interventions, and the second example included a PE of a depression medication monitoring service. Results/Discussion: The case examples demonstrate the need for strategic planning beforehand, including the use of a conceptual framework as well as appropriate study designs/methodology, measurement, and the need for consistency to achieve a well-designed PE. Using the recommendations within this article, it is hoped that the quality of PEs can be improved resulting in more generalizable data that can be used to inform organizations and policymakers to improve health care delivery.', 'Massachusetts Health Reform (MHR), implemented in 2006, introduced new health insurance options that may have prompted some veterans already enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) to reduce their reliance on VA health services. This study examined whether MHR was associated with changes in VA primary care (PC) use. Using VA administrative data, we identified 147,836 veterans residing in Massachusetts and neighboring New England (NE) states from October 2004 to September 2008. We applied difference-in-difference methods to compare pre-post changes in PC use among Massachusetts and other NE veterans. Among veterans not enrolled in Medicare, VA PC use was not significantly different following MHR for Massachusetts veterans relative to other NE veterans. Among VA-Medicare dual enrollees, MHR was associated with an increase of 24.5 PC visits per 1,000 veterans per quarter (p = .048). Despite new non-VA health options through MHR, VA enrollees continued to rely on VA PC.', 'Background: Negative experiences in the health care system, including perceived discrimination, can result in patient disengagement from health care. Four million US women give birth each year, and the perinatal period is a time of sustained interaction with the health care system, but potential consequences of negative experiences have not been examined in this context. We assessed whether perceived discrimination during the birth hospitalization were associated with postpartum follow-up care. Methods: Data were from the Listening to Mothers III survey, a nationally drawn sample of 2400 women with singleton births in US hospitals in 2011-2012. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds of having a postpartum visit in the 8 weeks following birth by perceptions of discrimination due to (1) race/ethnicity; (2) insurance type; and (3) a difference of opinion with a provider about care. Results: Women who experienced any of the 3 types of perceived discrimination had more than twice the odds of postpartum visit nonattendance (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28, P = 0.001), after adjusting for socioeconomic and medical characteristics. Conclusions: The postpartum visit is an opportunity for a patient and clinician to address continuing health problems following birth, discuss contraception, and screen for chronic disease. Forgoing this care may have negative health effects. The findings from this study underscore the need to reduce discrimination and improve maternity care experiences.', \"Purpose: Private and confidential health care is an important indicator of the quality of health care for adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of health care utilization and private and confidential health care among a nationally representative population of high school students. Methods: A two-stage cluster sample of 9,107 students (grades 8-12, response rate 73%) from 96 New Zealand high schools (response rate 84%) participated in a 2007 health survey using Internet tablets. Questions included when and where they had accessed health care, if their health care provider had explained that their health care was confidential, and if they had been seen in private by their health care provider. Results: Although 83% of students had accessed health care in the previous 12 months, only 27% of students reported receiving private and confidential health care. Students who had accessed health care from a school-based health center (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence interval] 1.54 [1.42-1.66]) or family planning/sexual health clinics (adjusted relative risk = 2.1 [1.9 - 2.26]) were more likely to report receiving private and confidential health care compared with students who had not accessed health care from these settings. Conclusions: While most young people access health care from their family doctor or general practitioner's clinic, rates of private and confidential health care were low suggesting that opportunities to adequately explore and respond to important yet sensitive topics are compromised in primary care settings.

However, the extent to which the resulting patterns of utilization represent high-quality care (compared to fee-for-service products) remains controversial. The authors sought to compare patterns of ambulatory care (including how diffuse or fragmented the care patterns were) for Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries vs. Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. A serial cross-sectional study of adults (>= 18 years old) was conducted using statewide Medicaid claims from New York State for calendar years 2010-2013. Beneficiaries were required to be continuously enrolled and have >= 4 ambulatory visits for each year they contributed data, yielding a sample of more than 1 million beneficiaries per year. Beneficiaries were characterized by age, sex, and case mix. For each year, ambulatory care patterns were compared across subgroups of beneficiaries using Poisson models (for numbers of visits and providers) and bounded Tobit models (for fragmentation scores). In 2010, among those who were not dual eligible, managed care beneficiaries had on average fewer visits (10.9 visits vs. 11.4 visits [P < 0.0001]) but more providers (3.8 providers vs. 3.3 providers [P < 0.0001]) and therefore more fragmentation (0.58 vs. 0.51 [P < 0.0001]) than fee-for-service beneficiaries, adjusting for age, sex, and case mix. These patterns persisted throughout the follow-up period and in sensitivity analyses. Less utilization is not necessarily more efficient care; a smaller number of visits spread across a larger number of providers creates more challenges for care coordination.', \"Health care education is facing common challenges of the education sector, such as ageing staff, time pressures, digitalization, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is part of a larger participatory international action research titled Developing Occupational Well-Being of Health Care Teachers in Estonia, 2021-2023. The objective of the study is to describe and evaluate health care teachers' occupational well-being at the pretest phase of the action research project, as well as to describe the occupational well-being development plan and related development activities at Tallinn Health Care College. The data were collected from health care teachers by an electronical survey (n = 46, response rate 46%). The quantitative data were analysed by statistical methods and qualitative data by deductive-inductive analysis. In general, the teachers were satisfied with their physical environment. Many considered their work important, and they were also satisfied with working time arrangements. Based on the pretest results, an occupational well-being development plan was created. Improving communication and ergonomics were established as the main objectives in the development strategy. These improvement activities will be part of the college's new development plan. Various activities have been planned to promote occupational well-being. These activities have already begun as seminars on communication, bullying, and ergonomics in the workplace and home office. The information can be utilized to develop long-term occupational well-being at Tallinn Health Care College. The results and good practices can enhance decision-making and education at local, regional, national, and international levels.\", 'Objective To determine whether vertically integrated hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is associated with more efficient use of postdischarge care and better outcomes. Data Sources Medicare provider, beneficiary, and claims data from 2012 to 2014. Study Design We compared facility characteristics, quality of care, and health care use for hospital-based SNFs and virtually integrated SNFs (defined as freestanding SNFs with close referral relationships with a single hospital) relative to nonintegrated freestanding SNFs. Among patients admitted to integrated SNFs, we estimated differences in health care use and outcomes for patients originating from the parent hospital (ie, receiving vertically integrated care) versus other hospitals using linear regressions that included SNF fixed effects. We estimated bounds for our main estimates that incorporated potential omitted variables bias. Data Extraction Methods We identified hospital-based SNFs based on provider data. We defined virtually integrated SNFs based on patient flows between hospitals and SNFs. We identified SNF episodes, preceding hospital stays, patient characteristics, health care use, and patient outcomes using Medicare data. Principal Findings Consistent with prior research, integrated SNFs performed better on quality measures and health care use relative to nonintegrated SNFs (eg, hospital-based SNFs had 11-day shorter stays compared with nonintegrated SNFs adjusting for patient characteristics, P < .001). Stroke patients admitted to hospital-based SNFs from the parent hospital had shorter preceding hospital stays (adjusted difference: -1.2 days, P = .001) and shorter initial SNF stays (adjusted difference: -2.7 days, P = .049); estimates were attenuated but still robust accounting for potential omitted variables bias. For stroke patients, associations between vertically integrated care and other outcomes were either statistically insignificant or not robust to accounting for potential omitted variables bias. Conclusions Vertically integrated hospital and SNF care was associated with shorter hospital and SNF stays. However, there were few beneficial associations with other outcomes, suggesting limited coordination benefits from vertical integration.', 'Objective - To analyse the influence of rates of general practitioner visits on rates of hospitalisations. Design - Ecological cross-sectional study of factors influencing hospitalisation rates. Aggregated data on primary care centre area level. Setting - The county of - Ostergotland, Sweden, with 3 hospital districts and 41 primary health care centres, and the hospital district of Jonkoping, in the county of Jonkoping, Sweden, with 11 primary health care centres. Outcome measure - Hospitalisation rates. Results - Age, and rates of outpatient hospital visits were the most important factors explaining the variation in rates of hospitalisations between the primary health care centre areas. Hospital districts, socioeconomic factors and rates of GP visits also influenced the rates of hospitalisations. Conclusion - When evaluating the influence of primary health care on the rates of hospitalisations, both socioeconomic factors and health care structure must be taken into consideration. Doing this, the rates of GP visits correlated negatively with the rates of hospitalisations.', \"BACKGROUND: Standard indicators of quality of care have been developed in the United States. Limited information exists about quality of care in countries with universal health care coverage. OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of preventive care and care for cardiovascular risk factors in a country with universal health care coverage. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort of a random sample of 1,002 patients aged 50-80 years followed for 2 years from all Swiss university primary care settings. MAIN MEASURES: We used indicators derived from RAND's Quality Assessment Tools. Each indicator was scored by dividing the number of episodes when recommended care was delivered by the number of times patients were eligible for indicators. Aggregate scores were calculated by taking into account the number of eligible patients for each indicator. KEY RESULTS: Overall, patients (44% women) received 69% of recommended preventive care, but rates differed by indicators. Indicators assessing annual blood pressure and weight measurements (both 95%) were more likely to be met than indicators assessing smoking cessation counseling (72%), breast (40%) and colon cancer screening (35%; all p < 0.001 for comparisons with blood pressure and weight measurements). Eighty-three percent of patients received the recommended care for cardiovascular risk factors, including > 75% for hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes. However, foot examination was performed only in 50% of patients with diabetes. Prevention indicators were more likely to be met in men (72.2% vs 65.3% in women, p < 0.001) and patients < 65 years (70.1% vs 68.0% in those a parts per thousand yen65 years, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Using standardized tools, these adults received 69% of recommended preventive care and 83% of care for cardiovascular risk factors in Switzerland, a country with universal coverage. Prevention indicator rates were lower for women and the elderly, and for cancer screening. Our study helps pave the way for targeted quality improvement initiatives and broader assessment of health care in Continental Europe.\", 'Prior research has demonstrated disparities in general medical care for patients with mental health conditions, but little is known about disparities in pain care. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality (PCQ) as documented by primary care clinicians in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We used natural language processing to analyze electronic health record data from a national sample of Veterans with moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain during primary care visits in the Fiscal Year 2017. Twelve PCQ indicators were annotated from clinician progress notes as present or absent; PCQ score was defined as the sum of these indicators. Generalized estimating equation Poisson models examined associations among mental health diagnosis categories and PCQ scores. The overall mean PCQ score across 135,408 person-visits was 8.4 (SD = 2.3). In the final adjusted model, post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with higher PCQ scores (RR = 1.006, 95%CI 1.002-1.010, P = .007). Depression, alcohol use disorder, other substance use disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder diagnoses were not associated with PCQ scores. Overall, results suggest that in this patient population, presence of a mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care. Perspective: This study used a natural language processing approach to analyze medical records to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality as documented by primary care clinicians. Findings suggest that presence of a diagnosed mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care.

An accessible primary care is an important part of the solution for how to provide affordable care for the population and reduce pressure on the overall health care system such as unnecessary hospital stays and associated costs. As primary care constitutes an important first line of healthcare, the task of prioritising and deciding what to do and for whom lies in practice, primarily with the primary care professionals. Thus, the decisions and behaviour of primary care professionals have a central role in achieving good and equal health in the population. The aim of this study is to explore how primary health care professionals handle situations with limited resources and enhance our knowledge of priorities in practice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 14 health care professionals (7 nurses, 7 physicians) working in Swedish primary care were interviewed. Data were analysed inductively with content analysis. Findings: Three main categories were found: Influx of patients; Structural conditions; and Actions. Each category illustrates an important aspect for what primary care professionals do to achieve good and equal care. The influx of patients concerned what the professionals handled in terms of patients' healthcare needs and patient behaviour. Structural conditions consisted of policies and goals set for primary care, competence availability, technical systems, and organisational culture. To handle situations due to limited resources, professionals performed different actions: matching health care needs with professionals' competency, defining care needs to suit booking systems appointments, giving care at the inappropriate health care level, rearranging workhours, and passing on the decision making. Conclusion: Priorities in primary care are not, one fits all  solution. Our study shows that priorities in primary care comprise of ongoing daily processes that are adapted to the situation, context of patient influx, and structural conditions. Healthcare professional's actions for how influx of patients' is handled in relation to limited resources, are created, and shaped within this context which also sets the boundaries for their actions.\", 'ContextMassachusetts enacted health care reform in 2006 to expand insurance coverage and improve access to health care. The objective of our study was to compare trends in health status and the use of ambulatory health services before and after the implementation of health reform in Massachusetts relative to that in other New England states. MethodsWe used a quasi-experimental design with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2001 to 2011 to compare trends associated with health reform in Massachusetts relative to that in other New England states. We compared self-reported health and the use of preventive services using multivariate logistic regression with difference-in-differences analysis to account for temporal trends. We estimated predicted probabilities and changes in these probabilities to gauge the differential effects between Massachusetts and other New England states. Finally, we conducted subgroup analysis to assess the differential changes by income and race/ethnicity. FindingsThe sample included 345,211 adults aged eighteen to sixty-four. In comparing the periods before and after health care reform relative to those in other New England states, we found that Massachusetts residents reported greater improvements in general health (1.7%), physical health (1.3%), and mental health (1.5%). Massachusetts residents also reported significant relative increases in rates of Pap screening (2.3%), colonoscopy (5.5%), and cholesterol testing (1.4%). Adults in Massachusetts households that earned up to 300% of the federal poverty level gained more in health status than did those above that level, with differential changes ranging from 0.2% to 1.3%. Relative gains in health status were comparable among white, black, and Hispanic residents in Massachusetts. ConclusionsHealth care reform in Massachusetts was associated with improved health status and the greater use of some preventive services relative to those in other New England states, particularly among low-income households. These findings may stem from expanded insurance coverage as well as innovations in health care delivery that accelerated after health reform.', \"This position paper aims to increase awareness among primary care practitioners and policymakers about the specific and complex health needs of people who experience incarceration. We focus on the importance of primary care and of continuity of care between prison and community. We highlight what is known from the literature on the health of people who experience incarceration, on the organisation of prison health care, and on the role of primary care both during and after detention. We present three case descriptions of detainees' encounters with the organisation of prison health care in three European countries. Finally, we describe the position that the European Forum for Primary Care takes. Prisoners and ex-prisoners have a worse physical and mental health compared with a cross-section of the population. However, access to good quality treatment and care is often worse than in the outside situation. In particular, well-organised primary care in the prison context could benefit prisoners and, indirectly, society at large. Moreover, continuity of care between the community and the prison situation needs improvement.\", 'Facing escalating health care expenditures, the governments of countries with national health insurance programs are trying to control or even to reduce health care utilization. Little research has examined the effects of decreased health care utilization on health outcomes. Applying a natural experiment design to the Taiwan population between 2000 and 2004, which includes the 2003 SARS epidemic when an average 20% decline in health care utilization occurred, this study examines the association between a decline in health care utilization and health outcomes measured by cause-specific mortality rates. We analyse the monthly mortality rates caused by infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus, nervous system diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, heart and other vascular diseases, respiratory system diseases, digestive system diseases, genitourinary system diseases and accidents. Models control for age, sex, month and year effects. Results show the heterogeneous effect of reduced health care utilization on health outcomes. Patients with diabetes mellitus or cerebrovascular diseases are vulnerable to short-term reductions in health care; compared with the non-SARS period, mortality caused by diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular diseases significantly increased during the SARS epidemic by 8.4% and 6.2%, respectively. No significant change in mortality rates caused by the other diseases or accidents is found. This study suggests that governments of countries where health care utilization and spending are similar to or inferior to those in Taiwan should carefully evaluate the impact of policies that attempt to reduce health care utilization. Furthermore, when an area encounters an epidemic, governments should be aware of the negative consequences of voluntary restraints on access to health care that accompany decreases in utilization.', \"Evaluate health care access and experiences with care among long-term survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer relative to a comparison group in the USA. The 2008 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys identified 1163 survivors of cancer, diagnosed ages 15-39, current ages 20-64, who were at least 5 years after diagnosis. A comparison group without cancer was matched using age, sex, and other characteristics. Primary outcomes included having a parts per thousand yen1 visit to doctor's office/clinic in the previous year and perceived health care quality (0 = worst to 10 = best; categorized as low (0-4), intermediate (5-7), and high (8-10)). Other experience-related outcomes (e.g., having adequate time with providers and providers show respect) were also evaluated. Bivariate analyses compared these outcomes between survivors and the comparison group. Multivariable logistic regressions identified survivor-level factors associated with health care visits and quality. Survivors had a parts per thousand yen1 visit more often (82.1 vs. 75.8 %, p = 0.005) yet rated their health care quality lower (low or intermediate 30.7 vs. 23.6 %, p < 0.001) than the comparison group. Fewer survivors reported always having enough time with providers (41.7 vs. 54.6 %, p < 0.001) and that providers always show respect (57.5 vs. 67.7 %, p = 0.002). Uninsured survivors were less likely to have a parts per thousand yen1 visit (odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.40, p < 0.001) and rated their health care quality lower (OR = 0.25, 95 % CI 0.13-0.48, p < 0.001) than privately insured. Many other factors were associated with visits and quality. Survivors of AYA cancer reported more health care visits but worse health care experiences than individuals without cancer. Targeted interventions that may improve survivors' experiences with health care should be evaluated.\", \"Introduction: This study examined the perspectives of pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) regarding the needs of adolescents, parents/caregivers, clinicians, and institutions in the health care transition (HCT) process for adolescents/young adults. Methods: PNPs (N = 170) participated in a luncheon for those interested in transition at an annual conference. Small groups discussed and recorded their perspectives related to health care transition from adolescent to adult services. Content analysis was used to analyze responses (Krippendorff, 2013). Results: Four themes, Education, Health care system, Support, and Communication, emerged from the data analysis. PNPs identified health care informatics and adolescents' use of technology as additional critical aspects to be considered in health care transition. Discussion: Opportunities and challenges identified by the PNPs are discussed to improve the quality and process of transitioning adolescents to adult services. This report will help National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners formulate a new Health Care Transition Policy Statement for the organization.\", 'The annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports document widespread and persistent racial and ethnic disparities. These disparities result from complex interactions between patient factors related to social disadvantage, clinicians, and organizational and health care system factors. Separate and unequal systems of health care between states, between health care systems, and between clinicians constrain the resources that are available to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups, contribute to unequal outcomes, and reinforce implicit bias. Recent data suggest slow progress in many areas but have documented a few notable successes in eliminating these disparities. To eliminate these disparities, continued progress will require a collective national will to ensure health care equity through expanded health insurance coverage, support for primary care, and public accountability based on progress toward defined, time-limited objectives using evidence-based, sufficiently resourced, multilevel quality improvement strategies that engage patients, clinicians, health care organizations, and communities.', \"This article explores the complexity of a health care system reforms in a post-conflict situation. It describes how the health care system was revamped immediately after the war, and then reorganized with Primary Health Care (PHC) as the fulcrum for change. It highlights the coordination problems, typical of a post-war situation when un-coordinated humanitarian assistance pours in. From the vantage points of Ministry of Health officials, the article details how the change process has gone over the years, the directions it has taken and the lessons learnt. It notes that reforms are often so fast that they outstrip the absorption capacity of the potential change agents because of their inadequate preparation for the new roles and responsibilities. This in turn threatens to undermine and weaken the very system that the reforms seek to strengthen. Several options adopted for change in Kosovo's health care system are at varying levels of implementation today. Some commentators have questioned if the policy for the new health care system has failed. We contend that there have been major organizational successes. But there are also shortcomings. There is also a potential danger that the health care system could partly revert to the old system. While some of the successes and shortcomings may be specific to Kosovo, many lessons learnt from Kosovo apply to health care reforms elsewhere.\", 'There is little or no role for primary care and family medicine in current health reforms in Mexico. However, robust evidence shows that primary care helps prevent morbidity and mortality and increases health equity. Mexico has participated in several international meetings sponsored by the World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations and the North American Primary Care Research Group that are aimed at increased understanding of national health systems and the need to strengthen primary care for improved health outcomes. From 1 of these meetings the Cancun Manifesto emerged, with a strategic plan to increase the stature and impact of the Mexican College of Family Physicians (COLMEXAC) in strengthening primary care in Mexico. We aim to describe this strategic plan and discuss its early implementation, and for this account to serve as a possible formula for other countries. The 5 specific strategies discussed are 1) the need for consensus on the leading role of the Mexican family physician in the national health system; 2) health ecology research; 3) to improve the perception of patients about the benefits of primary care and family medicine; 4) to organize meetings of health providers, users, and other stakeholders; and 5) to promote the professionalization of COLMEXAC as a legal entity.', \"Background: Despite the implementation of a mandatory health insurance (MHI) scheme in Togo since 2011, its coverage rate remains low, resulting in a high out-of-pocket payment rate. More than 10 years after its implementation, there are few empirical studies investigating the extent to which Togo's mandatory health insurance has improved beneficiaries' access to health care. Examining how MHI and healthcare use in Togo are related is the goal of this study. Methods: We use data from the Harmonized Survey on Living Conditions of Households (EHCVM), conducted in the member states of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) in 2018-2019 and covering 6,171 households in Togo. We employ multinomial logistic regression, given that the dependent variable is polytomous. Results: The results reveal a high rate of non-utilization of healthcare professionals in the case of illness, even among individuals with MHI coverage. Furthermore, the findings show that the MHI increases the likelihood of seeing a specialist physician and other formal health care professionals when sick. The results also reveal that a household's wealth is positively correlated with the likelihood of seeing formal health care professionals. Urban residents are statistically and significantly more likely than rural residents to see both a specialist physician and a general practitioner. The Grand Lome region has a statistically and significantly higher likelihood of seeing a specialist physician than the Maritime region. Conclusion :The results support the government's plan to implement universal health insurance. The government should take action to raise the standard of treatment provided to insured patients in health care centers. Additionally, the government should consider waiving medical fees for low-income policyholders. When waiving medical costs for low-income policyholders, the Togolese government should focus on the regions with the worst economic conditions. These interventions should be essential to ensure that no one is left behind. The difference between urban and rural communities should be reduced through supply-side policies that focus on rural areas.\", 'Background: There is increasing recognition in Canada and globally that a substantial proportion of health care delivered is inappropriate as evidenced by (1) harmful and/or ineffective practices being overused, (2) effective clinical practices being underused, and (3) other clinical practices being misused. Inappropriate health care leads to negative patient experiences, poor health outcomes, and inefficient use of scarce health care resources. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of inappropriate health care in Canada. Our specific objectives are to (1) systematically search and critically review published and grey literature for studies on inappropriate health care in Canada; (2) estimate the nature and magnitude of inappropriate health care in Canada and its provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Methods: We will include all quantitative study designs reporting objective or subjective measurements of inappropriate health care in Canada over the last 10 years. We will search the following online databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EconLit, and ISI-Web of Knowledge, which contains Web of Science Core Collection-Citation Indexes, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities. We will also search grey literature sources to identify provincial and national audits of inappropriate health care. Two authors will independently screen, assess data quality, and extract data for synthesis. Study findings will be synthesized narratively. We will organize our data into three care categorizations: preventive care, acute care, and chronic care. We will provide a compendium of inappropriate health care for each care category for Canada and each Canadian province and territory, where sufficient data exists, by calculating (1) overall medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse of clinical practices and (2) the range of medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse for each clinical practice investigated. Discussion: This review will result in the first-ever evidence-based compendium of inappropriate health care in Canada. We will also develop detailed reports of inappropriate health care for each Canadian province and territory.', 'Background: There are significant health status inequalities in Australia between those people living in rural and remote locations and people living in metropolitan centres. Since almost ninety percent of the population use some form of primary health care service annually, a logical initial step in reducing the disparity in health status is to improve access to health care by specifying those primary health care services that should be considered as core and therefore readily available to all Australians regardless of where they live. A systematic review was undertaken to define these core services. Using the question What primary health care services should residents of rural and remote Australia be able to access?, the objective of this paper is to delineate those primary health care core services that should be readily available to all regardless of geography. Method: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from established databases was undertaken. Relevant websites were also searched for grey literature. Key informants were accessed to identify other relevant reference material. All papers were assessed by at least two assessors according to agreed inclusion criteria. Results: Data were extracted from 19 papers (7 papers from the peer-reviewed database search and 12 from other grey sources) which met the inclusion criteria. The 19 papers demonstrated substantial variability in both the number and nature of core services. Given this variation, the specification or synthesis of a universal set of core services proved to be a complex and arguably contentious task. Nonetheless, the different primary health care dimensions that should be met through the provision of core services were developed. In addition, the process of identifying core services provided important insights about the need to deliver these services in ways that are fit-for-purpose in widely differing geographic contexts. Conclusions: Defining a suite of core primary health care services is a difficult process. Such a suite should be fit-for-purpose, relevant to the context, and its development should be methodologically clear, appropriate, and evidence-based. The value of identifying core PHC services to both consumers and providers for service planning and monitoring and consequent health outcomes is paramount.', 'Unsustainable development around the world has contributed to ecological degradation and human suffering while compromising the ability of ecosystems and social institutions to support human life. The United States health care system and its institutions are significant contributors to unsustainable development, but leaders of change are emerging from the health care arena. Health professionals, including primary care providers, are poised to serve as models for sustainability and to facilitate the necessary transformation toward more sustainable practices. Health professionals must, within a practical framework, embrace an objective definition of sustainability and then act to achieve it.', 'Purpose: The integration of mental health specialists into primary care has been widely advocated to deliver evidence-based mental health care to a defined population while improving access, clinical outcomes, and cost efficiency. Integrated care has been infrequently and inconsistently translated into real-world settings; as a result, the key individual components of effective integrated care remain unclear. Method: This article reports findings from a qualitative study that explored provider and client experiences of integrated care. We conducted in-depth interviews with integrated care providers (n = 13) and clients (n = 9) to understand their perspectives and experiences of integrated care including recommended areas for quality measurement and improvement. The authors used qualitative content and reflexive thematic analytic approaches to synthesize the interview data. Results: Clients and integrated care providers agreed regarding the overarching concepts of the what, how, and why of integrated care including co-location of care; continuity of care; team composition and functioning; client centeredness; and comprehensive care for individuals and populations. Providers and clients proposed a number of dimensions that could be the focus for quality measurement and evaluation, illuminating what is needed for successful context-sensitive spreading and scaling of integrated care interventions. Conclusion: With a mounting gap between the empirical support for integrated care approaches and the implementation of these models, there is a need to clarify the aims of integrated care and the key ingredients required for widespread implementation outside of research settings. This study has important implications for future integrated care research, and health care provider and client engagement in the quality movement.', 'OBJECTIVE: Material hardships, defined as difficulty meeting basic needs, are associated with adverse child health outcomes, including suboptimal health care utilization. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) may be more vulnerable to the effects of hardships. Our objective was to determine associations between material hardships and health care utilization among CSHCN. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study surveying caregivers of 2- to 12-year-old CSHCN in a low-income, urban area. Independent variables were parent-reported material hardships: difficulty paying bills, food insecurity, housing insecurity, and health care hardship. Dependent variables were parent-reported number of emergency department (ED) visits, any hospital admission, and any unmet health care need. We used negative binomial and logistic regression to assess for associations between each hardship and each outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 205 caregivers between July 2017 and May 2018 and analyzed the data in 2018. After adjustment, difficulty paying bills (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.12) and health care hardship (IRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.75) were associated with higher rates of ED visits. There were no associations between hardships and hospital admission. Difficulty paying bills (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.98), food insecurity (AOR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.02-3.71), and housing insecurity (AOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.36-5.40) were associated with higher odds of unmet health care need. CONCLUSIONS: Material hardships were associated with higher rates of ED visits and greater unmet health care need among low-income CSHCN. Future examination of the mechanisms of these associations is needed to enhance support for families of CSHCN.', 'Background We aim to investigate the costs associated with growth in the administrators, health care staff, and physicians to provide direction to establish a sustainable and cost-effective U.S. health care system. Methods Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, particularly the Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, were utilized from 2009 to 2020. Wages and employment of medical and health service managers (administrators), health care practitioners and technical operations (health care staff), and physicians were used to calculate the total cost. Results Administrator wages have grown similarly to health care staff wages (-4.40 vs -3.01%, P = .454) and physician wages (-4.40 vs -3.29%, P = .672). Additionally, there has been a similar increase in health care staff employment (9.91 vs 14.23%, P = .269) and physician employment (9.91 vs 15.35%, P = .252) compared to administrator employment. Overall, the total growth in administrator cost is similar to the growth in total health care staff cost (6.23 vs 11.80, P = .104) and total physician cost (6.23 vs 13.02%, P = .079). In 2020, physicians had the highest employment growth but the smallest wage increase. Conclusion Although health care staff experienced a greater percent growth in employment and cost per employee than administrators since 2009, the cost per administrator remains greater than that of health care staff. Understanding differences in wages and costs is essential to reduce health care spending without compromising access, delivery, and quality of health care services.', \"Background Effective deployment of AI tools in primary health care requires the engagement of practitioners in the development and testing of these tools, and a match between the resulting AI tools and clinical/system needs in primary health care. To set the stage for these developments, we must gain a more in-depth understanding of the views of practitioners and decision-makers about the use of AI in primary health care. The objective of this study was to identify key issues regarding the use of AI tools in primary health care by exploring the views of primary health care and digital health stakeholders. Methods This study utilized a descriptive qualitative approach, including thematic data analysis. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with primary health care and digital health stakeholders in Ontario. NVivo software was utilized in the coding of the interviews. Results Five main interconnected themes emerged: (1) Mismatch Between Envisioned Uses and Current Reality-denoting the importance of potential applications of AI in primary health care practice, with a recognition of the current reality characterized by a lack of available tools; (2) Mechanics of AI Don't Matter: Just Another Tool in the Toolbox- reflecting an interest in what value AI tools could bring to practice, rather than concern with the mechanics of the AI tools themselves; (3) AI in Practice: A Double-Edged Sword-the possible benefits of AI use in primary health care contrasted with fundamental concern about the possible threats posed by AI in terms of clinical skills and capacity, mistakes, and loss of control; (4) The Non-Starters: A Guarded Stance Regarding AI Adoption in Primary Health Care-broader concerns centred on the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI use in primary health care; and (5) Necessary Elements: Facilitators of AI in Primary Health Care-elements required to support the uptake of AI tools, including co-creation, availability and use of high quality data, and the need for evaluation. Conclusion The use of AI in primary health care may have a positive impact, but many factors need to be considered regarding its implementation. This study may help to inform the development and deployment of AI tools in primary health care.\", 'Objective: to map the available evidence on the main topics investigated in palliative care in primary health care. Method: scoping review type study carried out in five databases, including original articles, based on the descriptors palliative care, palliative care at the end of life, terminal care, terminal state, primary health care and their respective acronyms and synonyms, totaling 18 publications. The extraction of data from primary studies was performed using an instrument produced by the authors and which allowed the construction of the categories presented. Results: 18 publications were included in this review. Among the most studied themes are the difficulties of the teams regarding the continuity of care in the health network; the importance of in-service education by the multidisciplinary team; professional unpreparedness; bioethics; the validation and application of scales for prognosis and care for some pathologies such as cancer and diabetes; among others. Conclusion: it became evident that palliative care in primary health care has been gradually developed, but it is necessary to consider the organization of primary health care and the social policies that support or weaken it, being considered a complex challenge.', 'The health care system of the Arkhangelsk region experiences numerous difficulties. Insufficient financing, budget deficit, social tension negatively affect the health status of the population. Low birth-rate and high death-rate result in the decrease of population in number. A big number of traumas in men at the able-bodied age conditions the death-rate increase. The epidemiological situation in the region is Setting worse. It mostly refers to tuberculosis, syphilis, scabies, mental disorders, oncological diseases. The indices of the health status of children worsens. The main shortcomings of the present health care system are caused by insufficient out - patient medical aid and predominance of costly in-patient treatment. The draft of the programme on regional policy in health care, the tasks and the main trends of the reform of health care system in the Arkhangelsk region are presented for consideration.', \"Health care reform in Vermont promotes patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) and multi-disciplinary community health teams to support population health. This qualitative study describes the expansion of Vermont's health care reform efforts, initially focused on adult primary care, to pediatrics through interviews with project managers and facilitators, CHT members, pediatric practitioners and care coordinators, and community-based providers. Analyses used grounded theory, identifying themes confirmed by repeat occurrence across respondents. Respondents believed that PCMH recognition and financial and community supports would improve care for pediatric patients and families. Respondents shared three main challenges with health care reform efforts: achieving PCMH recognition, adapting community health teams for pediatric patients and families, and defining roles for care coordinators. For health care reform efforts to support pediatric patients and be family-centered, states may need additional resources to understand how pediatric and adult primary care differ and how best to support pediatrics during health care reform efforts.\", 'The precondition for implementation of decentralisation in health care is the education and empowerment of medical professionals and local politicians for management and decision-making. The decentralisation in health care has to be planned to suit the needs of regions and population (bottom-up), and not to follow the uniform model devised by the central government. The processes of decentralisation can have a negative effect on the quality of health care, increase prices and emphasise inequity in health. The poorly managed decentralisation can slow down the development and block the changes.', \"One strategy to promote workforce well-being has been health incentive plans, in which a company's insured employees are offered compensation for completing a particular health-related activity. In 2015, Providence Health & Services adopted an Advance Care Planning (ACP) activity as a 2015-2016 health incentive option. More than 51,000 employees and their insured relatives chose the ACP incentive option. More than 80% rated the experience as helpful or very helpful. A high proportion (95%) of employees responded that they had someone they trusted who could make medical care decisions for them, yet only 23% had completed an advance directive, and even fewer (11%) had shared the document with their health care provider. The most common reason given for not completing an advance directive was that health care providers had never asked about it. These findings suggest that an insured employee incentive plan can encourage ACP consistent with the health care organizations' values and strategic priorities.\", 'The literature highlights that disparities in health care performance exist. Publicly reporting data about disparities at an actionable level is needed. The Minnesota Health Care Disparities Report is designed to publicly report medical group health care performance rates for patients enrolled in state/federally funded programs. In addition, differences between patients enrolled in state-funded public programs and those in private or Medicare programs at statewide and medical group levels are presented. The endeavor is a cooperative one between Minnesota Community Measurement, an independent nonprofit community organization, and the Minnesota Department of Human Services, the state Medicaid agency. Public reporting makes transparent the gaps in the delivery of health care between patients enrolled in these programs at a medical group level and can facilitate quality improvement locally, where accountability lies and actions to address disparities can occur.', 'The Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded health care coverage and recognizes mental health as a major priority. However, individuals suffering from mental health disorders still face layered barriers to receiving health care, especially Asian Americans. Integration of behavioral health services within primary care is a viable way of addressing underutilization of mental health services. This paper provides insight into a comprehensive care approach integrating behavioral health services into primary care to address underutilization of mental health services in the Asian American population. True integration of behavioral health services into primary care will require financial support and payment reform to address multi-disciplinary care needs and optimize care coordination, as well as training and workforce development early in medical and mental health training programs to develop the skills that aid prevention, early identification, and intervention. Funding research on evidence-based practice oriented to the Asian American population needs to continue.', \"ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of China's health-care reform from 2009 to 2011 by examining Chinas annual health-care workforce statistics of 2008 and 2011. DesignThe design of the study was a secondary data analysis. Main outcome measureThe main outcome measure used was the Primary Health Care Worker Accessibility Index (PHCWA). ResultsThe statistics illustrated the impact health-care reform had on the provision of primary health care in rural areas. The results showed that the health-care reform of 2009 generally improved access to the primary health-care workforce in all 28 areas (range of increase: 13.18-324.0%). However, an increasing disparity in regional health care based on the increase of the standard deviations of PHCWA (range of increase: 36.44-77.10%) may be an issue that policy-makers and analysts will have to face. ConclusionsConcerted policy efforts from both the provincial and central governments are needed to narrow the gaps. Regional development should not only focus on the economic aspect, but also account for the fact that the adequate provision of primary health care is part of the infrastructure that makes development possible and sustainable.\", \"This paper introduces this mini-series on vertical equity in health care. It reflects on the fact that by and large equity policies in health care have failed and that there is a need for positive discrimination to promote equity better in future. This positive discrimination is examined under the heading of `vertical equity'. The paper considers Varian's notion of 'envy' as a basis for equity in health care but concludes that this is not a helpful route to go down. Better it would seem to pursue the idea from Sen of 'freedoms' and 'communitarian claims' (as raised previously by this author). While it is argued that procedural justice is to be preferred in the longer run as a basis for equity there are gains in adopting a short run goal of promoting distributive justice. Some preliminary evidence is presented on the weighting of health gains to reflect such vertical equity concerns.\", 'BACKGROUNDAn asymmetrical oral disease burden is endured by certain population subgroups, particularly children and adolescents. Reducing oral health disparities requires understanding multiple oral health perspectives, including those of adolescents. This qualitative study explores oral health perceptions and dental care behaviors among rural adolescents. METHODSSemistructured individual interviews with 100 rural, minority, low socioeconomic status adolescents revealed their current perceptions of oral health and dental care access. Respondents age ranged from 12 to 18 years. The sample was 80% black and 52% male. RESULTSPerceived threat from dental disease was low. Adolescents perceived regular brushing and flossing as superseding the need for preventive care. Esthetic reasons were most often cited as reasons to seek dental care. Difficulties accessing dental care include finances, transportation, fear, issues with Medicaid coverage and parental responsibility. In general, adolescents and their parents are in need of information regarding the importance of preventive dental care. CONCLUSIONSFindings illuminate barriers to dental care faced by low-income rural adolescents and counter public perceptions of government-sponsored dental care programs as being free or without cost. The importance of improved oral health knowledge, better access to care, and school-based dental care is discussed.']\n"

      "['The oral health of older people living in residential aged care facilities has been widely recognised as inadequate. The aim of this paper is to identify barriers to effective engagement of health-care providers in oral care in residential aged care facilities. A literature review was conducted using MEDline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete and PsychInfo between 2000 and 2013, with a grey literature search of government and non-government organisation policy papers, conference proceedings and theses. Keywords included: dental/oral care, residential aged care, health-care providers, barriers, constraints, and limitations. A thematic framework was used to synthesise the literature according to a series of oral health-care provision barriers, health-care provider barriers, and cross-sector collaborative barriers. A range of system, service and practitioner level barriers were identified that could impede effective communication/collaboration between different health-care providers, residents and carers regarding oral care, and these were further impeded by internal barriers at each level. Findings indicated several areas for investigation and consideration regarding policy and practice improvements. While further research is required, some key areas should be addressed if oral health care in residential aged care services is to be improved.', 'This paper explores how one health care purchasing coalition in Minnesota, the Buyers Health Care Action Group (BHCAG), has taken an active role in restructuring its local health care market. BHCAG started with the belief that the consumer should be the motivating force in health care delivery. Unfortunately, providing consumers with the information and incentives they need to make informed, effective health care decisions has triggered numerous problems. This paper examines groups of providers who network to form care systems, and explores the roles of consumers, employers, and health plans in the current market. It identifies specific methods for gathering data and distributing information to the consumer, and discusses the problems associated with attempting to implement quality improvement, as well as the questions that arise when the market does not support those improvements.', \"Introduction: Having a health care home has been shown to be associated with positive health outcomes for children with special health care needs (CSHCN), but its relationship to parental coping has not been established. The purpose of this study was to explore the health care home as a process of care related to parental coping with day-to-day demands of raising a CSHCN. Method: Data are from a sample of 18,352 CSHCN in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health. Using the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as a framework, this secondary analysis explored relationships between child and household factors and parental coping among CSHCN with and without a health care home. Results: CSHCN in a health care home were more likely to have parents who were coping well. Parents who received sufficient care coordination were more satisfied with provider communication, and those who reported that care was family-centered reported better coping. Discussion: Results suggest that the health care home represents a process of care that may help families manage the daily demands of caring for CSHCN through family-centered care, provider-to-provider communication, and provision of care coordination. J Pediatr Health Care. (2012) 26, 266-275.\", 'The role of health care inequalities in social inequalities in health should be reconsidered since the quality of health care varies according to the social status. Some of the health care inequalities are constructed by not taking account of health inequalities in the development of programs or recommendations of medical practice and thus ending up with management procedures that do not reduce inequalities to a minimum but even contribute to increasing them. Other health care inequalities are due to omission, linked to the operating inertia of a health care system that does not recognize these inequalities and has no plan to catch them up. To reverse this situation it seems necessary to act at the three levels of the health care system: to change the clinical paradigm at the micro level, tackle the organizations issues at the meso level, and pursue the reform of the entire health care system at the macro level.

Materials and Methods: Pilot, prospective cohort study of 50 surrogates of adult, mechanically ventilated patients surveyed on days 1, 3, and 7 of ICU admission. Results: Responses on the Health Care System Distrust Scale on day 1 ranged from 9 to 34 (possible range 9-45, with higher scores indicating more distrust), with a mean and SD of 20.3 +/- 6.9. Factor analysis demonstrated a 2-factor structure, corresponding to the domains of values and competence. Cronbach alpha for the overall scale was .83, for the competence subscale, .76, and for the values subscale, .74. Health-care system distrust was inversely correlated with trust in ICU physicians (Pearson coefficient - .63). When evaluated over the course of each patient's ICU stay, health-care system distrust ratings decreased by 0.31 per patient-day (95% CI 0.55-0.06, P = .015). Correlation between health-care system distrust and trust in ICU physicians decreased slightly over time. Conclusions: Among surrogates in the ICU, the Health Care System Distrust Scale has high internal consistency and convergent validity. There was substantial variability in surrogates' trust in the healthcare system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Recommendations were developed and refined based on expert input, evidence review, and stakeholder engagement. Participating stakeholders included experts from academia, health care organizations, industry, and government.Study DesignExpert group consensus, informed by stakeholder engagement and targeted evidence review.Data Collection/Extraction MethodsPriority themes were derived iteratively through (1) brainstorming and idea reduction, (2) targeted evidence review of candidate themes, (3) determination of preliminary themes; (4) input on preliminary themes from stakeholders attending AHRQ's 2022 Health Equity Summit; and (5) and refinement of themes based on that input. The final set of research and action recommendations was determined by authors' consensus.Principal FindingsHealth care delivery systems have contributed to racial and ethnic disparities in health care. High quality research is needed to inform health care delivery systems approaches to undo systemic barriers and inequities. We identified six priority themes for research; (1) institutional leadership, culture, and workforce; (2) data-driven, culturally tailored care; (3) health equity targeted performance incentives; (4) health equity-informed approaches to health system consolidation and access; (5) whole person care; (6) and whole community investment. We also suggest cross-cutting themes regarding research workforce and research timelines.ConclusionsAs the nation's primary health services research agency, AHRQ can advance equitable delivery of health care by funding research and disseminating evidence to help transform the organization and delivery of health care.\", \"The objective was to estimate the association between health care expenditures and implementation of preventive mental health programs by local health departments (LHDs). Multilevel nationally representative data sets were linked to test the hypothesis that LHDs' provision of preventive mental health programs was associated with cost savings. A generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution and state-fixed effects was used to estimate the association between LHDs' mental illness prevention services and total health care expenditures per person per year for adults aged 18 years and older. The main outcome measure was the annual total health care expenditure per person. The findings indicated that LHD provision of population-based prevention of mental illness was associated with an $824 reduction (95% confidence interval: -$1,562.94 to -$85.42, P < 0.05) in annual health care costs per person, after controlling for individual, LHD, community, and state characteristics. LHDs can play a critical role in establishing an integrated health care model. Their impact, however, has often been underestimated or neglected. Results showed that a small investment in LHDs may yield substantial cost savings at the societal level. The findings of this research are critical to inform policy decisions for the expansion of the Public Health 3.0 infrastructure.\", \"Purpose: This qualitative descriptive study explored Jordanian health care providers' perceptions of the health care that they provide for post-partum mothers. Methods: Thirty Jordanian health care providers (physicians, nurses and midwives) participated in three focus group discussions. A content analysis approach was used to analyse the data as appropriate for descriptive qualitative inquiry. Findings: Health care providers indicated that the care they deliver includes breastfeeding, family planning, childcare and laboratory tests. Health care providers reflected confidence in the care given but indicated the need for continuing education, more resources and expressions of appreciation. Conclusions: Findings provide insights into Jordanian health care providers' perspectives on post-partum health care and emphasized the importance of enhancing utilization of such care in Jordan. It is suggested that the Jordanian Ministry of Health develop a comprehensive plan of educational offerings for providers, with a standardized educational programme for post-partum women. It is essential that all health care facilities provide high-quality post-partum health care that meets the needs of the maternal/infant dyad. Like all qualitative descriptive studies, generalizability of the results may be limited to similar Situations and cultures.\", 'The objective of this study is to examine the causal effect of health care utilization on unmet health care needs. An IV approach deals with the endogeneity between the use of health care services and unmet health care, using the presence of drug insurance and the number of physicians by health region as instruments. We employ three cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey confidential master files (2003, 2005, and 2014). We find a robustly negative relationship between health care use and unmet health care needs. One more visit to a medical doctor on average decreases the probability of reporting unmet health care needs by 0.014 points. The effect is negative for the women-only group whereas it is statistically insignificant for men; similarly, the effect is negative for urban dwellers but insignificant for rural ones. Health care use reduces the likelihood of reporting unmet health care. Policies that encourage the use of health care services, like increasing the coverage of public drug insurance and increasing after hours accessibility of physicians, can help reduce the likelihood of unmet health care.', 'The United States is one of a very few high-income countries that does not guarantee every person the right to health care. Residents of the United States pay more out-of-pocket for increasingly worse outcomes. People of color, those who have lower incomes, and those who live in rural areas have less access to health care and are therefore at even greater risk for poor health. Universal health care, a term for various models of health care systems that provide care for every resident of a given country, will help move the United States toward higher quality, more affordable, and more equitable care. This article defines a reproductive justice and human rights foundation for universal health care, explores how health insurance has worked historically in the United States, identifies the economic reasons for implementing universal health care, and discusses international models that could be used domestically.', \"Introduction: Although recent health care reforms will expand insurance coverage for U. S. children, disparities regarding access to pediatric care persist, even among the insured. We investigated the separate and combined effects of having health insurance and a usual source of care (USC) on children's receipt of health care services. Methods: We conducted secondary analysis of the nationally representative 2002-2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data from children (<= 18 years of age) who had at least one health care visit and needed any additional care, tests, or treatment in the preceding year (n = 20,817). Results: Approximately 88.1% of the study population had both a USC and insurance; 1.1% had neither one; 7.6% had a USC only, and 3.2% had insurance only. Children with both insurance and a USC had the fewest unmet needs. Among insured children, those with no USC had higher rates of unmet needs than did those with a USC. Discussion: Expansions in health insurance are essential; however, it is also important for every child to have a USC. New models of practice could help to concurrently achieve these goals.

Method: A scoping review was performed. First, relevant studies were identified in 4 databases (n = 74). Independent reviewers selected eligible studies. Numerical and thematic analyses were performed to draft a preliminary framework including a definition. Next, the feasibility of the framework and definition was explored by physical therapy primary health care organization experts. Results: Numerical and thematic data on health care quality and context-specific performance resulted in a health care value framework for physical therapy primary health care organizations-including a definition of health care value, namely to continuously attain physical therapy primary health care organization-centered outcomes in coherence with patient- and stakeholder-centered outcomes, leveraged by an organization's capacity for change. Conclusion: Prior literature mainly discussed health care quality and context-specific performance for primary health care organizations separately. The current study met the need for a value-based framework, feasible for physical therapy primary health care organizations, which are for a large part micro or small. It also solves the omissions of incoherent literature and existing frameworks on continuous health care quality and context-specific performance. Future research is recommended on longitudinal exploration of the HV (health care value) framework.\", 'Informal care by adult children is a common form of long-term care for older adults and can reduce medical expenditures if it substitutes for formal care.

Required is the integration of health and social care, beyond traditional health care services to address social determinants. This study investigates key care components to support complex patients and their families in the community. Methods: Expert panel focus groups with 24 care providers, working in health and social care sectors across Toronto, Ontario, Canada were conducted. Patient vignettes illustrating significant health and social care needs were presented to participants. The vignettes prompted discussions on i) how best to meet complex care needs in the community and ii) the barriers to delivering care to this population. Results: Categories to support care needs of complex patients and their families included i) relationships as the foundation for care, ii) desired processes and structures of care, and iii) barriers and workarounds for desired care. Discussion and Conclusions: Meeting the needs of the population who require health and social care requires time to develop authentic relationships, broadening the membership of the care team, communicating across sectors, co-locating health and social care, and addressing the barriers that prevent providers from engaging in these required practices.', \"Objectives. To describe the health care system and health care delivery in Greenland. Study design and method. This was a literature study that included literature and articles searched in PubMed published from 1989 to 2009 about health care in Greenland. Results. The health care system is a publicly financed governmental responsibility. Its major challenges are limited economic resources, Greenland's demographic structure, rapid epidemiological changes, increased public demand for specialized treatment, difficulty in recruiting professionals and the economic burden imposed by around-the-clock maintenance of specialized staff in sparsely populated areas. To meet these challenges, a public health program focusing on health promotion and prevention, educational initiatives to improve recruitment and a system reorientation moving towards larger health care regions is proposed to be gradually implemented from 2010. One fundamental component of this plan is tying the system together with a telemedicine system and in the future also with a joint electronic patient file system. The importance of better surveillance and monitoring of health has been recognized, while securing best clinical practice and implementing better steering instruments on resource allocation and quality are areas needing focus in the future. Conclusion. Many of the challenges for the Greenlandic health care system are being addressed with promising strategies, but only the future will show whether they are successful.

Aims: The objective of the paper is to present for the first time in public national health-care workforce census data for the first two years of the economic recession and the adopted bailout mechanism (2010 and 2011) (a) to evaluate the adequacy of the governmental effort in terms of organization and management of the health-care workforce in PHC; and (b) to identify constraints and opportunities for the development of an integrated PHC ensuring access to health-care services for all. Methods: Data were drawn from the national project 'Health Monitoring Indicators System: Health Map' coordinated scientifically by the National School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology. They referred to the 202 PHCs and their regional surgeries (with 98% response rate). Descriptive statistics and frequency distributions were used for the analysis. Findings: The findings pointed that PHC absorbs a very limited part of the national health system's workforce. Important inequalities in the numerical and geographical allocation of the PHC health workforce specialties across the country in favor of the medical profession and to the detriment of rural areas and the islands were identified, raising concerns about the policymakers' ability to meet the emerging needs of the population, as the retrospective study of the health-care workforce, since 2010, reveals that the numerical and per type allocations remained almost unchanged. These results were in line with previous studies showcasing the lack of holistic approach for PHC questioning the restrictive spending policy (ie, salary and benefit cuts for the health-care professionals, important discharges and nonrenewal of the personnel) adopted in the public health-care sector.\", \"Aim: The aim of this paper is to examine Canadian key informants' perceptions of intrapersonal (within an individual) and interpersonal (among individuals) factors that influence successful primary care and public health collaboration. Background: Primary health care systems can be strengthened by building stronger collaborations between primary care and public health. Although there is literature that explores interpersonal factors that can influence successful inter-organizational collaborations, a few of them have specifically explored primary care and public health collaboration. Furthermore, no papers were found that considered factors at the intrapersonal level. This paper aims to explore these gaps in a Canadian context. Methods: This interpretative descriptive study involved key informants (service providers, managers, directors, and policy makers) who participated in one h telephone interviews to explore their perceptions of influences on successful primary care and public health collaboration. Transcripts were analyzed using NVivo 9. Findings: A total of 74 participants [from the provinces of British Columbia (n = 20); Ontario (n = 19); Nova Scotia (n = 21), and representatives from other provinces or national organizations (n = 14)] participated. Five interpersonal factors were found that influenced public health and primary care collaborations including: (1) trusting and inclusive relationships; (2) shared values, beliefs and attitudes; (3) role clarity; (4) effective communication; and (5) decision processes. There were two influencing factors found at the intrapersonal level: (1) personal qualities, skills and knowledge; and (2) personal values, beliefs, and attitudes. A few differences were found across the three core provinces involved. There were several complex interactions identified among all inter and intra personal influencing factors: One key factor - effective communication - interacted with all of them. Results support and extend our understanding of what influences successful primary care and public health collaboration at these levels and are important considerations in building and sustaining primary care and public health collaborations.\", \"Background: Adequate care for individuals living with chronic illnesses calls for a healthcare system redesign, moving from acute, disease-centered to patient-centered models. The aim of this study was to identify Belgian stakeholders' perceptions on the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the healthcare system for people with chronic diseases in Belgium. Methods: Four focus groups were held with stakeholders from the micro and meso level, in addition to two interviews with stakeholders who could not attend the focus group sessions. Data collection and the discussion were based on the Chronic Care model. Thematic analysis of the transcripts allowed for the identification of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats of the current health care system with focus on chronic care. Results: Informants stressed the overall good quality of the acute health care system and the level of reimbursement of care as an important strength of the current system. In contrast, the lack of integration of care was identified as one of the biggest weaknesses of today's health care system, along with the unclear definitions of the roles and functions of health professionals involved in care processes. Patient education to support self-management exists for patients with diabetes and/or terminal kidney failure but not for those living with other or multiple chronic conditions. The current overall fee-for-service system is a barrier to integrated care, as are the lack of incentives for integrated care. Attending multidisciplinary meetings, for example, is underfinanced to date. Finally, clinical information systems lack interoperability, which further impedes the information flow across settings and disciplines. Conclusion: Our study's methods allowed for the identification of problematic domains in the health system for people living with chronic conditions. These findings provided useful insights surrounding perceived priorities. This methodology may inspire other countries faced with the challenge of drafting reforms to tackle the issue of chronic care.\", \"Many rural veterans receive care in community settings but could benefit from VA services for certain needs, presenting an opportunity for coordination across systems. This article details the Collaborative Systems of Care (CSC) program, a novel, nurse-led care coordination program identifying and connecting veterans presenting for care in a Federally Qualified Health Center to VA behavioral health and other services based upon the veteran's preferences and eligibility. The CSC program systematically identifies veteran patients, screens for common behavioral health issues, explores VA eligibility for interested veterans, and facilitates coordination with VA to improve healthcare access. While the present program focuses on behavioral health, there is a unique emphasis on assisting veterans with the eligibility and enrollment process and coordinating additional care tailored to the patient. As VA expands its presence in community care, opportunities for VA-community care coordination will increase, making the development and implementation of such interventions important.\", \"Health literacy is fundamental if people are to successfully manage their own health. This requires a range of skills and knowledge about health and health care, including finding, understanding, interpreting and communicating health information, seeking of appropriate care and making critical health decisions. A primary health system that is appropriate and universally accessible requires an active agenda based on research of approaches to address low health literacy, while health care providers should be alert to the widespread problems of health literacy which span all age levels. 7-bis article reviews the progress made in Australia on health literacy in primary health care since health literacy was included in Australia's health goals and targets in the mid-1990s. A database search of published literature was conducted to identify existing examples of health literacy programs in Australia. Considerable work has been done on mental health literacy, and research into chronic disease self-management with CALD communities, which, includes health literacy, is under way. However, the lack of breadth in research has led to a knowledge base that is patchy. The few Australian studies located on health literacy research together with the data about general literacy in Australia suggests the need for much, more work to be done to increase our knowledge base about health literacy, in order to develop appropriate resources and tools to manage low health literacy in primary health settings.\", \"Medicare is central to accessing health care in Australia, yet many asylum seekers are ineligible for this scheme. In NSW, Medicare ineligible asylum seekers have some access to public health care under the Medicare Ineligible Asylum Seekers - Provision of Specified Public Health Services policy. This policy was updated in November 2020 to clarify services where a fee waiver applies for asylum seekers without Medicare. We examined the experiences of Medicare ineligible asylum seekers in accessing health care in New South Wales (NSW) in light of the revised policy. Employing qualitative methods, we conducted semi-structured interviews with asylum seekers (n = 7) and service providers (n = 6) in South Western Sydney. The interviews were analysed using thematic analysis and the socio-ecological model was used to interpret the data. Participants identified that chronic and mental health conditions are the main health issues for asylum seekers. Factors across the four levels of the socio-ecological model were identified as influencing the health care of asylum seekers, including a lack of awareness about health care rights at the individual level, support from relatives and friends at the interpersonal level, providers' lack of awareness of fee waivers at the organizational level and limited access to primary health care at the policy level. The results imply that Medicare ineligible asylum seekers in NSW do not have optimal access to health care which may worsen existing health disparities. Educational initiatives that improve service providers' and asylum seekers' awareness of the revised policy are needed to improve asylum seeker health equity in NSW.\", 'Objective To disentangle the relationships among food insecurity, health care utilization, and health care expenditures. Data Sources/Study Setting We use national data on 13 465 adults (age >= 18) from the 2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), the first year of the food insecurity measures. Study Design We employ two-stage empirical models (probit for any health care use/expenditure, ordinary least squares, and generalized linear models for amount of utilization/expenditure), controlling for demographics, health insurance, poverty status, chronic conditions, and other predictors. Principal Findings Our results show that the likelihood of any health care expenditure (total, inpatient, emergency department, outpatient, and pharmaceutical) is higher for marginal, low, and very low food secure individuals. Relative to food secure households, very low food secure households are 5.1 percentage points (P < .001) more likely to have any health care expenditure, and have total health care expenditures that are 24.8 percent higher (P = .011). However, once we include chronic conditions in the models (ie, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, emphysema, high cholesterol, cancer, diabetes, arthritis, and asthma), these underlying health conditions mitigate the differences in expenditures by food insecurity status (only the likelihood of any having any health care expenditure for very low food secure households remains statistically significant). Conclusions Policy makers and government agencies are focused on addressing deficiencies in social determinants of health and the resulting impacts on health status and health care utilization. Our results indicate that chronic conditions are strongly associated with food insecurity and higher health care spending. Efforts to alleviate food insecurity should consider the dual burden of chronic conditions. Finally, future research can address specific mechanisms underlying the relationships between food security, health, and health care.', 'BackgroundPrimary health care (PHC) is the ideal setting to provide integrated services centred on the person and to implement health promotion (HP) activities. ObjectiveTo identify proposals to approach HP in the context of primary care according to health-care users aged 45-75years, key community informants and primary care centre (PCC) workers. MethodsDescriptive-interpretive qualitative research with 276 participants from 14 PCC of seven Spanish regions. A theoretical sampling was used for selection. A total of 25 discussion groups, two triangular groups and 30 semi-structured interviews were carried out. A thematic interpretive contents analysis was carried out. ResultsParticipants consider that HP is not solely a matter for the health sector and they emphasize intersectoral collaboration. They believe that it is important to strengthen community initiatives and to create a healthy social environment that encourages greater responsibility and participation of health-care users in decisions regarding their own health and better management of public services and resources. HP, care in the community and demedicalization should be priorities for PHC. Participants propose organizational changes in the PCC to improve HP. PCC workers are aware that HP falls within the scope of their responsibilities and propose to increase their training, motivation, competences and knowledge of the social environment. Informants emphasize that HP should be person-centred approach and empathic communication. HP activities should be appealing, ludic and of proven effectiveness. ConclusionsAccording to a socio-ecological and intersectoral model, PHC services must get actively involved in HP together with community and through outreach interventions.', \"Background Ukraine is reforming its health care system to improve quality of health care. Insight into how primary health care managers perceive quality is important for the ongoing reform as well as for the improvement of medical services. Methods An online survey was conducted as part of the Ukrainian-Swiss project Medical Educational Development in April-May 2019 based on the contact list of USAID project Health Reform Support, and additionally on the database of the National Health Service of Ukraine and other channels. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and qualitative data analysis. Results In total, 302 health care managers took part in the study. The majority of primary health care managers perceive quality in health care as process quality. They associate quality mostly with compliance to standards. At the same time, primary health care managers prefer to assess outcome quality via a system of indicators and feedback. There appears to be a lack of consensus about health care quality. This may be due to a lack of awareness of the national strategy for better quality of health care service. Conclusions Our study provides new insights into primary care managers' perceptions of health care quality in Ukraine. The absence of a clear consensus about quality complicates the discussion about quality and how to measure quality in health care. This appears to be one of the obstacles to system-wide quality improvement.\", 'ObjectivesThis study explores the relationship between end-of-life care costs and place of death across different health and social care sectors.MethodsWe used a linked local government and health data of East London residents (n=4661) aged 50 or over, deceased between 2016 and 2020. Individuals who died in hospital were matched to those who died elsewhere according to a wide range of demographic, socioeconomic and health factors. We reported mean healthcare costs and 95% CIs by care sectors over the 12-month period before death. Subgroup analyses were conducted to investigate if the role of place of death differs according to long-term conditions and age.ResultsWe found that mean difference in total cost between hospital and non-hospital decedents was & POUND;4565 (95% CI & POUND;3132 to & POUND;6046). Hospital decedents were associated with higher hospital cost (& POUND;5196, & POUND;4499 to & POUND;5905), higher mental healthcare cost (& POUND;283, & POUND;78 to & POUND;892) and lower social care cost (-& POUND;838, -& POUND;1,209 to -& POUND;472), compared with individuals who died elsewhere. Subgroup analysis shows that the association between place of death and healthcare costs differs by age and long-term conditions, including cancer, mental health and cardiovascular diseases.ConclusionThis study suggests that trajectories of end-of-life healthcare costs vary by place of death in a differential way across health and social care sectors. High hospital burden for cancer patients may be alleviated by strengthening healthcare provision in less cost-intensive settings, such as community and social care.', \"Objective. To examine the relationship between features of managed care organizations (MCOs) and health care use patterns by children. Data Sources. Telephone survey data from 2,223 parents of children with special health care needs, MCO-administrator interview data, and health care claims data. Study Design. Cross-sectional survey data from families about the number of consequences of their children's conditions and from MCO administrators about their plans' organizational features were used. Indices reflecting the MCO characteristics were developed using data reduction techniques. Hierarchical models were developed to examine the relationship between child sociodemographic and health characteristics and the MCO indices labeled: Pediatrician Focused (PF) Index, Specialist Focused (SF) Index, and Fee-for-Service (FFS) Index, and outpatient use rates and charges, inpatient admissions, emergency room (ER) visits, and specialty consultations. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. The telephone and MCO-administrator survey data were linked to the enrollment and claims files. Principal Findings. The child's age, gender, and condition consequences were consistent predictor variables related to health care use and charges. The PF Index was associated with decreased outpatient use rates and charges and decreased inpatient admissions. The SF Index was associated with increased ER visits and decreased specialty consultations, while the FFS Index was associated with increased outpatient use rates and charges. Conclusion. After controlling for sociodemographic and health characteristics, the PF, SF, and FFS indices were significantly associated with children's health care use patterns.\", \"BackgroundEfforts to progress oral healthcare reform can be challenging with competing interests of governments and service providers to achieve the intended outcomes. The value-based health care approach has been adopted in many areas of healthcare but has had limited applications to oral healthcare systems. Dental Health Services Victoria, an Australian state government funded entity, commenced its journey to value-based health care in 2016, to shift away from traditional dental service models that reward activity and volume towards a stronger emphasis on value and outcomes. AimsTo maintain the value-based health care agenda focus, Dental Health Services Victoria developed three key principles, which can be adopted by other organisations engaged in reforming oral healthcare, to improve the oral health for the population it serves. Materials & MethodsIn 2018, Dental Health Services Victoria developed a value-based health care framework, which has informed strategic organisation priorities for action. In 2023, the following three key principles are identified as being essential to support the operationalisation and development of effective models of oral healthcare: Principle 1 - Care is co-designed with the person or population Principle 2 - Prevention and early intervention are prioritised. Principle 3 - Consistent measurement of health outcomes and costs are embedded. DiscussionThe exploration of the three key principles is an important communication tool to translate value-based health care into practice with key stakeholders. Further work is required to socialise them to within dental teams. ConclusionOrganisations looking to commence the value-based health care agenda can apply Dental Health Services Victoria's three key principles as a first step.\", 'Background: The objective of the Balearic Islands Palliative Care (PC) Program is to improve the quality of PC through a shared model consisting of primary health care professionals, home-based PC teams, and PC units in hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), patients with advanced cancer and other terminal diseases benefit from early identification and proactive PC. We will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention in which a PC leader is established in the primary health care center, and assess the effect of this intervention on the early identification of patients in need of PC, the efficient use of health care services, and direct health care costs. Methods: Design: A two-arm cluster randomized clinical trial of 30 Primary Health Care Centers (PHCC) in Mallorca (Spain), in which each center was randomized to an intervention arm or a usual care arm. We expect that the number of patients identified as suitable for PC (including non-oncological PC) is at least 5% greater in the intervention arm. Sample size: A total of 4640 deceased patients. Outcomes will be assessed by a blinded external review of the electronic records. Interventions: General practitioners (GPs) and nurse leaders in PC for each PHCC will be appointed. These leaders will help promote PC training of colleagues, improve symptom management and psychological support of patients, and evaluate the complexity of individual cases so that these cases receive assistance from PC home-based teams. Measurements: Early identification (>90 days before death), evaluation of case complexity, level of case complexity (with referral to a home-based PC team), use and cost of hospital and primary care services, and quality of life during the last month of life (>= 2 emergency room visits, >= 2 hospital admissions, >= 14 days of hospitalization). Discusion: PC leaders in primary care teams will improve the early identification of patients eligible for PC. This initiative could improve the quality of end-of-life care and utilization of hospital resources.', 'Objective: To evaluate an innovative rural service offering comprehensive primary health care for mental health service clients. Design: A formative evaluation using mixed methods. Setting: A rural NSW community. Participants: Fifteen health care providers and 120 adult clients. Intervention: A monthly clinic held in a general practice to provide primary health care for clients of the community mental health team. Main outcome measures: Client utilisation and clinic activity data. Provider views of service effectiveness, possible improvements and sustainability. Results: The GP Clinic has operated successfully for 2.5 years without access block. Some 52% of clients had no physical illness and 82% were referred to other health and community services. In total, 40% continued to attend the clinic while 32% went on to consult a GP independently. Client access to care improved as did collaboration between the community mental health team and primary care providers. Conclusion: The GP Clinic is a straightforward and flexible service model that could be used more widely.', \"BackgroundPeople with prediabetes are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and its complications, such as cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. Primary prevention and health maintenance are therefore imperative. Evidence has shown that prediabetes can be prevented or delayed with behavioural change, mainly in eating habits and physical activity. Interventions that use a person-centered approach can lead to improvements in self-management, quality of life, and health outcomes. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research that engages healthcare professionals and people with prediabetes in constructing and implementing preventive programs. The purpose of this study is to explore and describe how healthcare professionals perceive prediabetes, the current challenges in its detection and treatment, and what is needed to improve quality of care.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted in Region Stockholm. A total of 26 primary health care professionals participated in individual interviews: 15 diabetes nurses and/or district nurses, five general practitioners, five dietitians, and one physiotherapist. Interview transcripts were analyzed with qualitative content analysis.ResultsThe analysis revealed two main themes that emphasize the need to make prediabetes more visible in primary health care. Despite the healthcare professionals' engagement and their motivation to improve prediabetes care, ad hoc practices and the absence of clear screening guidelines and referral pathways made it harder to focus on primary prevention. Supporting professionals in implementing structured care for people with prediabetes might encourage more efficient interprofessional collaboration and contribute to better strategies for promoting behavioural change.ConclusionsEstablishing prediabetes care guidelines, supporting health care professionals ' knowledge and skills in prediabetes care, and implementing interprofessional referral pathways are some steps to enhance prediabetes detection and care precedence in primary health care. These steps could lead to more preventive care and ensure patient safety and health care equity.\", \"Introduction: Aging is associated with multiple chronic conditions. In older age, health needs and demand for health services utilization increase. There are limited data in Nepal on the health care utilization as well as health care costs among the elderly population. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the factors hindering access to health care among Nepalese older adults. Our study aims to explore the health care utilization and expenditure among Nepali older adults. Method: A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 401 older adults residing in Pokhara Lekhnath metropolitan of Nepal. The survey tool was adapted from the Study on Global Aging and Adult Health (SAGE)'s questions on Health Care Utilization. The predictors of health care utilization were assessed in binary logistic regression models. Results: Study participants, mean (+/- SD) age 70.2 (+/- 8.0) years, had various preexisting conditions such as hypertension (37.7 %), gastritis (28.4 %), asthma (25.4 %), and arthritis (23.4%) reported in the past 12 months but only 70% visited a health facility. A notable proportion (30%) of participants didn't utilize health services despite having a health problem. The utilization of out-patient and in-patient health services were 87.5 and 14.6% respectively. The use of private health facilities (56.4%) was high compared to the use of government health facilities (35.7%). Privileged ethnicity, living with a partner, higher annual income, knowledge of social insurance, and multi-morbidity were associated with higher odds of utilizing health services. Participants of privileged ethnicity, with higher household income, attending private health facility, and having multi-morbidities had significantly higher out of pocket health expenditures. Conclusions: A notable proportion of elderly participants did not utilize health services despite having a health problem. The public health system must develop effective strategies to attract this segment of the society. High dependency on private health facilities, as noted in the study, will only lead toward higher out of pocket health expenditures. The health benefits of regular health screenings must be disseminated among the elderly population. Developing quality and affordable health care services for older adults to ensure equity in accessibility will be a major task for the public health system in Nepal.\", \"AimThis paper describes the policy context and approaches taken to improve access to primary health care in Australia by supporting nurses to deliver improved integrated care meeting community needs. ContextIn Primary Health Care (PHC), the nursing workforce are predominantly employed in the general practice sector. Despite evidence that nurse-led models of care can bridge traditional treatment silos in the provision of specialised and coordinated care, PHC nurses' scope of practice varies dramatically. Nurse-led models of care are imperative for rural and remote populations that experience workforce shortages and barriers to accessing health care. Existing barriers include policy constraints, limited organisational structures, education and financing models. ApproachThe Australian Primary Health Care Nurses Association (APNA) received funding to implement nurse-led clinics as demonstration projects. The clinics enable PHC nurses to work to their full scope of practice, improve continuity of care and increase access to health care in under serviced locations. We reviewed a range of peer-reviewed literature, policy documents, grey literature and APNA provided sources, particularly those relevant to rural and remote populations. We argue more focus is needed on how to address variations in the scope of practice of the rural and remote PHC nursing workforce. ConclusionDespite growing evidence for the effectiveness of nurse-led models of care, significant policy and financial barriers continue to inhibit PHC nurses working to their full scope of practice. If their potential to transform health care and increase access to health services is to be realised these barriers must be addressed.\", 'This paper investigates whether managed care ameliorates or aggravates ethnic and racial health care disparities in Medicare. First, we analyze the choice of type of insurance made by Medicare enrollees to see if minorities are more likely to choose the managed care alternative. Second, we study the differential effect of managed care on disparities using several measures of access, use and cost of services. Both analyses are conducted on two independent data sets, the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey and the National Health Interview Survey. We conclude that relative to Whites, minorities are at least as well off-in terms of benefits and costs-in Medicare managed care as in Medicare traditional indemnity plans. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Methods. A 3-year experimental study was conducted in 5 California counties and 111 licensed child care centers (73 intervention, 38 comparison) participated at the baseline and post-intervention times. Trained research assistants conducted objective observations with a Policies Checklist and Health and Safety Checklist, which were composed of key national health and safety standards. Results. At baseline, both groups were not significantly different on the Policies Checklist and the Health and Safety Checklist. At the post intervention time, intervention centers had significantly more and higher-quality written health and safety policies on 9 of the 10 policies rated (medication administration. care of mildly ill children, exclusion of ill children, cleaning and sanitizing, handwashing, daily health checks, inclusion of children with special needs, emergency preparedness, staff health) than comparison centers. At the post-intervention time, intervention centers improved their health and safety practices in the areas of emergency preparedness and handwashing, controlling for consultation model, time in study, and director turnover. Both groups improved their indoor and outdoor facilities and overall Health and Safety Checklist means. Conclusions. Child care health consultation programs can improve the written health and safety policies and may improve practices in child care centers.\", 'Background: The medical home (MH) model has prompted increasing attention given its potential to improve quality of care while reducing health expenditures. Objectives: We compare overall and specific health care expenditures in Belgium, from the third-party payer perspective (compulsory social insurance), between patients treated at individual practices (IP) and at MHs. We compare the sociodemographic profile of MH and IP users. Research Design: This is a retrospective study using public insurance claims data. Generalized linear models estimate the impact on health expenditures of being treated at a MH versus IP, controlling for individual, and area-based sociodemographic characteristics. The choice of primary care setting is modeled using logistic regressions. Subjects: A random sample of 43,678 persons followed during the year 2004. Measures: Third-party payer expenditures for primary care, secondary care consultations, pharmaceuticals, laboratory tests, acute and long-term inpatient care. Results: Overall third-party payer expenditures do not differ significantly between MH and IP users ((sic)+27). Third-party payer primary care expenditures are higher for MH than for IP users ((sic)+129), but this difference is offset by lower expenditures for secondary care consultations ((sic)-11), drugs ((sic)-40), laboratory tests ((sic)-5) and acute and long-term inpatient care ((sic)-53). MHs attract younger and more underprivileged populations. Conclusions: MHs induce a shift in expenditures from secondary care, drugs, and laboratory tests to primary care, while treating a less economically favored population. Combined with positive results regarding quality, MH structures are a promising way to tackle the challenges of primary care.', \"Background To improve mental health care access, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) implemented Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) in clinics nationally. Primary care clinical leader satisfaction can inform model implementation and may be facilitated by collaborative care managers and technology supporting cross-specialty collaboration. Objective (1) To determine primary care clinical leaders' overall satisfaction with care from embedded mental health providers for a range of conditions and (2) to examine the association between overall satisfaction and two program features (care managers, technology). Design Cross-sectional organizational survey in one VA region (Southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico), 2018. Participants Sixty-nine physicians or other designated clinical leaders in each VA primary care clinic (94% response rate). Main Measures We assessed primary care clinical leader satisfaction with embedded mental health care on four groups of conditions: target, non-target mental health, behavioral health, suicide risk management. They additionally responded about the availability of mental health care managers and the sufficiency of information technology (telemental health, e-consult, instant messaging). We examined relationships between satisfaction and the two program features using chi(2)tests and multivariable regressions. Key Results Most primary care clinical leaders were very satisfied with care for targeted anxiety (71%) and depression (69%), but not for other common conditions (37% alcohol misuse, 19% pain). Care manager availability was significantly associated with very satisfied responses for depression (p = .02) and anxiety care by embedded mental health providers (p = .02). Highly rated sufficiency of communication technology (only 19%) was associated with very satisfied responses to suicide risk management (p = .002). Conclusions Care from embedded mental health providers for depression and anxiety was highly satisfactory, which may guide improvement among less satisfactory conditions (alcohol misuse, pain). Observed associations between overall satisfaction and collaborative care features may inform clinics on how to optimize staffing and technology based on priority conditions.\", 'Background: Immigrants make up one fifth of the Canadian population and this number continues to grow. Adequate access to primary health care is important for this population but it is not clear if this is being achieved. This study explored patient reported access to primary health care of a population of immigrants in Ontario, Canada who were users of the primary care system and compared this with Canadian-born individuals; and by model of primary care practice. Methods: This study uses data from the Comparison of Models of Primary Care Study (COMP-PC), a mixed-methods, practice-based, cross-sectional study that collected information from patients and providers in 137 primary care practices across Ontario, Canada in 2005-2006. The practices were randomly sampled to ensure an equal number of practices in each of the four dominant primary care models at that time: Fee-For-Service, Community Health Centres, and the two main capitation models (Health Service Organization and Family Health Networks). Adult patients of participating practices were identified when they presented for an appointment and completed a survey in the waiting room. Three measures of access were used, all derived from the patient survey: First Contact Access, First Contact Utilization (both based on the Primary Care Assessment Tool) and number of self-reported visits to the practice in the past year. Results: Of the 5,269 patients who reported country of birth 1,099 (20.8%) were born outside of Canada. In adjusted analysis, recent immigrants (arrival in Canada within the past five years) and immigrants in Canada for more than 20 years were less likely to report good health compared to Canadian-born (Odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.36,0.92 and 0.81, 95% CI 0.67,0.99). Overall, immigrants reported equal access to primary care services compared with Canadian-born. Within immigrant groups recently arrived immigrants had similar access scores to Canadian-born but reported 5.3 more primary care visits after adjusting for health status. Looking across models, recent immigrants in Fee-For-Service practices reported poorer access and fewer primary care visits compared to Canadian-born. Conclusions: Overall, immigrants who were users of the primary care system reported a similar level of access as Canadian-born individuals. While recent immigrants are in poorer health compared with Canadian-born they report adequate access to primary care. The differences in access for recently arrived immigrants, across primary care models suggests that organizational features of primary care may lead to inequity in access.', 'BackgroundHealthcare coordination and continuity of care conceptualize all care providers and organizations involved in health care to ensure the right care at the right time. However, systematic evidence synthesis is lacking in the care coordination of health services. This scoping review synthesizes evidence on different levels of care coordination of primary health care (PHC) and primary care.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of published evidence on healthcare coordination. PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched until 30 November 2022 for studies that describe care coordination/continuity of care in PHC and primary care. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to select studies. We analysed data using a thematic analysis approach and explained themes adopting a multilevel (individual, organizational, and system) analytical framework.ResultsA total of 56 studies were included in the review. Most studies were from upper-middle-income or high-income countries, primarily focusing on continuity/care coordination in primary care. Ten themes were identified in care coordination in PHC/primary care. Four themes under care coordination at the individual level were the continuity of services, linkage at different stages of health conditions (from health promotion to rehabilitation), health care from a life-course (conception to elderly), and care coordination of health services at places (family to hospitals). Five themes under organizational level care coordination included interprofessional, multidisciplinary services, community collaboration, integrated care, and information in care coordination. Finally, a theme under system-level care coordination was related to service management involving multisectoral coordination within and beyond health systems.ConclusionsContinuity and coordination of care involve healthcare provisions from family to health facility throughout the life-course to provide a range of services. Several issues could influence multilevel care coordination, including at the individual (services or users), organizational (providers), and system (departments and sectors) levels. Health systems should focus on care coordination, ensuring types of care per the healthcare needs at different stages of health conditions by a multidisciplinary team. Coordinating multiple technical and supporting stakeholders and sectors within and beyond health sector is also vital for the continuity of care especially in resource-limited health systems and settings.', \"Background: In 2010, a national integrated health care standard for (childhood) obesity was published and disseminated in the Netherlands. The aim of this study is to gain insight into the needs of health care providers and the barriers they face in terms of implementing this integrated health care standard. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was applied using focus groups, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews and an e-mail-based internet survey. The study's participants included: general practitioners (GPs) (focus groups); health care providers in different professions (face-to-face interviews) and health care providers, including GPs; youth health care workers; pediatricians; dieticians; psychologists and physiotherapists (survey). First, the transcripts from the focus groups were analyzed thematically. The themes identified in this process were then used to analyze the interviews. The results of the analysis of the qualitative data were used to construct the statements used in the e-mail-based internet survey. Responses to items were measured on a 5-point Likert scale and were categorized into three outcomes: 'agree' or 'important' (response categories 1 and 2), 'disagree' or 'not important'. Results: Twenty-seven of the GPs that were invited (51 %) participated in four focus groups. Seven of the nine health care professionals that were invited (78 %) participated in the interviews and 222 questionnaires (17 %) were returned and included in the analysis. The following key barriers were identified with regard to the implementation of the integrated health care standard: reluctance to raise the subject; perceived lack of motivation and knowledge on the part of the parents; previous negative experiences with lifestyle programs; financial constraints and the lack of a structured multidisciplinary approach. The main needs identified were: increased knowledge and awareness on the part of both health care providers and parents/children; a social map of effective intervention; structural funding; task rearrangements; a central care coordinator and structural information feedback from the health care providers involved. Conclusions: The integrated health care standard stipulate that the care of overweight or obese children be provided using an integrated approach. The barriers and needs identified in this study can be used to define strategies to improve the implementation of the integrated health care standard pertaining to overweight and obese children in the Netherlands.\", 'Background Due to gender inequities that exist for women of childbearing age, there exists a need to deliver care tailored to their needs and preferences. Patient-centred care (PCC) can be used to meet these needs. This review aims to compare patient care delivery between PCC and obstetrical care. This can help us address how PCC should be delivered to women before, during and after pregnancy versus how it is delivered to patients regardless of sex. Methods A review of literature was conducted on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and SCOPUS for English PCC and high-quality perinatal reviews published between 2010 and 2021. The data were analysed using a modified Walker and Avant framework. Results A total of 2138 unique studies were identified, with 11 PCC and 9 high-quality obstetrical care studies included. Common defining features between PCC and obstetrical care include respect and dignity, informed decision-making, therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. PCC-specific features were holistic care, empowerment, individualized care, coordinated care and empathy. Unique high-quality obstetrical care themes included continuity of care, privacy and confidentiality, provider education and status, physical environment and equitable maternal care. Conclusions There are shared defining attributes between PCC and obstetrical care, including respect and dignity, informed decision-making, the therapeutic alliance, effective communication, social relationships and autonomy. However, there remain unique defining attributes for high-quality obstetrical care and PCC. This highlights the need for a unique approach to obstetrical care. More research on care for different physiological conditions in women is needed to address patient care that addresses different parts of the lifespan and develop frameworks that can influence health policy, patient care and health system evaluation. Patient or Public Contribution This study was one part of a larger, multicomponent study of how to implement PCC for women across the lifespan. While we did not specifically consult or involve women in this dual concept analysis, our larger study (content analysis of clinical guidelines and government policies, qualitative interviews with women and clinicians, Delphi study to prioritize consensus recommendations for achieving PCC for women) was guided by the experiences and input of a 50+ women advisory panel.', \"Policy Points A consensus regarding the need to orient health systems to address inequities is emerging, with much of this discussion targeting population health interventions and indicators. We know less about applying these approaches to primary health care. This study empirically demonstrates that providing more equity-oriented health care (EOHC) in primary health care, including trauma- and violence-informed, culturally safe, and contextually tailored care, predicts improved health outcomes across time for people living in marginalizing conditions. This is achieved by enhancing patients' comfort and confidence in their care and their own confidence in preventing and managing health problems. This promising new evidence suggests that equity-oriented interventions at the point of care can begin to shift inequities in health outcomes for those with the greatest need. Context Significant attention has been directed toward addressing health inequities at the population health and systems levels, yet little progress has been made in identifying approaches to reduce health inequities through clinical care, particularly in a primary health care context. Although the provision of equity-oriented health care (EOHC) is widely assumed to lead to improvements in patients' health outcomes, little empirical evidence supports this claim. To remedy this, we tested whether more EOHC predicts more positive patient health outcomes and identified selected mediators of this relationship. Methods Our analysis uses longitudinal data from 395 patients recruited from 4 primary health care clinics serving people living in marginalizing conditions. The participants completed 4 structured interviews composed of self-report measures and survey questions over a 2-year period. Using path analysis techniques, we tested a hypothesized model of the process through which patients' perceptions of EOHC led to improvements in self-reported health outcomes (quality of life, chronic pain disability, and posttraumatic stress [PTSD] and depressive symptoms), including particular covariates of health outcomes (age, gender, financial strain, experiences of discrimination). Findings Over a 24-month period, higher levels of EOHC predicted greater patient comfort and confidence in the health care patients received, leading to increased confidence to prevent and manage their health problems, which, in turn, improved health outcomes (depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, chronic pain, and quality of life). In addition, financial strain and experiences of discrimination had significant negative effects on all health outcomes. Conclusions This study is among the first to demonstrate empirically that providing more EOHC predicts better patient health outcomes over time. At a policy level, this research supports investments in equity-focused organizational and provider-level processes in primary health care as a means of improving patients' health, particularly for those living in marginalizing conditions. Whether these results are robust in different patient groups and across a broader range of health care contexts requires further study.\", 'Introduction: The study objectives are to describe the national health and safety standards in family child care homes (FCCHs) and child care centers and compare them by child care type. Method: Child care health consultants and research assistants completed the standardized Health and Safety Checklist, which comprised key national health and safety standards, in a convenience sample of 21 FCCHs and 31 child care centers enrolled in two larger studies conducted in CA. Results: The checklist was completed in 1 or 2 hours in FCCHs and centers, respectively. The internal consistency of the overall checklist subscales was moderate to strong. Eight of 10 checklist subscales were not significantly different in FCCHs and centers, but outdoor facilities (p < .05) and supervision, interaction, and physical activity (p < .05) were different. Discussion: The Health and Safety Checklist is valid in FCCHs and centers and identifies targeted interventions for nurses to improve child care quality.', 'Background: Use of telemental health has increased among rural Medicare beneficiaries, particularly among individuals with serious mental illness (SMI). Little is known about what leads to the initiation of telemental health. Objective: To categorize the different patterns of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health services among individuals with SMI. Methods: A cohort of rural beneficiaries with SMI (defined as schizophrenia/related psychotic disorders or bipolar disorder) with an index telemental health visit in 2010-2017 was built using claims for a 20% random sample of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries. The authors used latent class analysis to identify classes of mental health care use in the 6 months before the index telemental health visits. Across the classes, the authors also described characteristics of index and subsequent mental health visits. Results: The cohort included 4930 rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Three classes of mental health care use before initiation of telemental health were identified. The largest class (n=3066) had minimal use of primary care provider mental health care and the second largest class (n=1537) had minimal specialty mental health care. The smallest class (n=327) was characterized by recent hospitalization or emergency department care. In the overall cohort, index visits were frequently established visits and were often with specialty prescribers. Conclusions: Our findings highlight 3 distinct patterns of care before telemental health initiation, providing insight into the role that telemedicine may play in mental health care for rural Medicare beneficiaries with SMI. Overall, telemental health was most often used to maintain care with existing providers.', \"Purpose: Youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) increasingly live into adulthood, and approximately 500,000 U.S. youth transition from pediatric to adult health care systems annually. Through a systematic literature review, we sought to (1) determine adult outcomes for YSHCN who have no special transition interventions and (2) identify evidence for strategies that lead to better outcomes, in particular, access to adult health care. Methods: We searched the medical, nursing, psychology, and social science literature and reviewed selected articles' reference lists. Transition experts also recommended relevant articles. Search criteria included health conditions, transition-related activities, and health care and related outcomes. We selected English-language articles published from 1986 to 2010, with an abstract, description of transition-related interventions (objective 2), and posttransition outcomes. Investigators abstracted study design, population, sample size, description of intervention, data collection methods, and findings. Results: The search yielded 3,370 articles, of which 15 met study criteria. Although many YSHCN appear to make the transition to adult health providers successfully, some experience serious gaps in outcomes; those with more complex conditions or with conditions affecting the nervous system appear to have less good transitions. Some evidence supports introducing YSHCN to adult providers before leaving the pediatric system; one study supports using care coordinators to improve outcomes. Conclusions: Evidence regarding programs to facilitate transition for YSHCN is inconclusive. Weak evidence suggests that meeting adult providers before transfer may facilitate posttransition access to care. We recommend additional studies with strong research designs to guide best practice in preparing YSHCN for adulthood. (c) 2012 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

Despite these efforts, many Americans do not have access to basic medical care. This study was designed to identify barriers faced by low-income parents when accessing health care for their children and how insurance status affects their reporting of these barriers. METHODS A mixed methods analysis was undertaken using 722 responses to an open-ended question on a health care access survey instrument that asked low-income Oregon families, Is there anything else you would like to tell us? Themes were identified using immersion/crystallization techniques. Pertinent demographic attributes were used to conduct matrix coded queries. RESULTS Families reported 3 major barriers: lack of insurance coverage, poor access to services, and unafforclable costs. Disproportionate reporting of these themes was most notable based on insurance status. A higher percentage of uninsured parents (87%) reported experiencing difficulties obtaining insurance coverage compared with 40% of those with insurance. Few of the uninsured expreswsed concerns about access to services or health access to services or health care costs (19%). Access concerns were the most common among publicly insured families, and costs were more often mentioned by families with private insurance. Families made a clear distinction between insurance and access, and having one or both elements did not assure Care. Our analyses-income families. uncovered a 3-part typology of barriers to health care for low-income families. CONCLUSIONS Barriers to health care can be insurmountable for low-income families, even those with insurance coverage. Patients who do not seek care in a family medicine clinic are not necessarily getting their care elsewhere.', 'Purpose: To examine health care spending patterns for U.S. adolescents aged 10 to 18 years using nationally representative household survey data. Methods: We analyzed data from the 1997 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey on total expenditures and out-of-pocket expenditures for health care based on a sample of 4882 adolescents. Results: Compared with that for adults, health care expenditures for adolescents were low, averaging $799 per adolescent in 1997. Disabled and functionally impaired adolescents had disproportionately high expenditures ($1960 per capita). Blacks and adolescents living in poor families had disproportionately low expenditures ($358 and $609 per capita, respectively). Professional services provided by physicians and dentists accounted for more than one-half of all health care spending for adolescents. Only 2% of adolescents were hospitalized in 1997, but they accounted for about one-fifth of all health care expenditures. The share of health expenditures paid out of pocket varied by type of service, ranging from 3% for inpatient hospital care to 51% for dental care. When covered, insurance provided substantial financial protection for families of adolescents: those with public coverage paid 8%, those with private coverage paid 32%, and those without coverage paid 61% of their health care bills out of pocket. The share of health care bills paid out of pocket would be much lower if dental care was excluded. Conclusions: On the basis of our findings that health care expenditures for adolescents are low and that insurance coverage provides critically needed financial protection, we conclude that further expansions of public and private health insurance coverage for this population would provide significant benefits at modest additional cost. Additional efforts to improve coverage of services that are not now well-covered, such as dental care, would also be valuable.

Design: A retrospective study based on a national casualty clinic registry and data from reimbursement claims. Setting: Out-of-hours primary health care in Norway. Subjects: All Norwegian casualty clinics in 2016 and reimbursement claims from 2008 to 2015. Main outcome measures: Percent of casualty clinics with ultrasound, types of ultrasound devices and probes, reasons for/against ultrasound access, characteristics of clinics with/without ultrasound, frequency of five ultrasound indications and characteristics of the physicians using/not using ultrasound. Results: Out of 182 casualty clinics, 41 (23%) reported access to ultrasound. Mobile (49%) and stationary (44%) devices were most frequent. Physician request was the most common cited reason for ultrasound access (66%). Neither population served by the casualty clinic nor distance to hospital showed any clear association with ultrasound access. All of the five ultrasound reimbursement codes showed a substantial increase from 2008 to 2015 with 14.1 ultrasound examinations being performed per 10,000 consultations in 2015. Only 6.5% of physicians performed ultrasound in 2015 and males were significantly more likely to use ultrasound than females (OR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.38-2.47, p<.001), even when adjusted for age, speciality status and geography. Conclusions: Although the use of ultrasound is increasing in out-of-hours Norwegian primary health care, most casualty clinics do not have access and only a minority of physicians use ultrasound.', \"The use of information and communication technologies in health and health care could improve healthcare quality in many ways. Today's evidence base demonstrates the (cost-)effectiveness of online education, self-management support and tele-monitoring in several domains of health and care. While new results gradually provide more evidence for eHealth's impact on quality issues, now is the time to come to grips with implementation issues. Documented drawbacks such as low acceptance, low adoption or low adherence need our attention today to make the most of eHealth' potential. Improvement science is beginning to deliver the tools to address these persistent behavioural and cultural issues. The ceHRes Roadmap, for instance, is a plural and pragmatic approach that includes users' needs. It is now imperative to improve our implementation strategies in order to scale up eHealth technologies. This will accelerate the much needed transformation of our healthcare systems and sustain access, affordability and quality for all in the near future.\", \"Work disability creates significant expenses for nations and causes human suffering by limiting patients' lives. International studies show that to enhance recognition of and support for work disability, cooperation, mutual trust, and information exchange between public primary health care and occupational health care must be strengthened. However, little is known of how health care professionals experience this cooperation. The aim of this study was to understand how professionals experience the cooperation between public primary health care and occupational health services regarding patients' work ability. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 29 health care professionals working in five small cities (<10,000 inhabitants) in Finland. Interviews were audio and video recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed through inductive thematic analysis. Three key themes were identified from the interviews: attitudes toward the other health care sector, the exchange of information, and resources for cooperation. Professionals seem to have poor knowledge about the services available and how care is given in the other sector, appearing to lead to weak mutual trust. The public primary health care professionals especially emphasized the benefits of cooperation, but several issues were mentioned as barriers to cooperation. These results can be used when planning effective patient paths and service provisioning models.\", \"During the last decade there has been considerable international mobilisation around shrinking the role of States in health care. The World Bank reports that, in many low and middle-income countries, private sources of finance comprise the largest share of total national health expenditures. Private sector health care is ubiquitous, reaches throughout the population, preferred by the people and is significant from both economic as well as health perspective. Resources are limited, governments are weak, and a new approach is needed. This paper provides a broad overview and raises key issues with regard to private health care. The focus is on provision of health care by private medical providers. On the background of the world's common health problems and interventions available to tackle them, the place of private health care in the overall context is first discussed. The concept of privatisation within the various forms of health care systems is then explained. The paper then describes the genesis and key elements of rapidly enhancing role of the private sector in health care and points to the paucity of literature from low and middle-income countries. Common concerns about private health care are outlined. Two illustrative examples - tuberculosis, the top infectious killer among the poor and coronary heart disease, the top noninfectious killer among the I ich - are presented to understand the current and possible role of private sector in provision of health care. Highlighting the need to distinguish between health care as a public good or a market commodity, the paper leaves it to the reader to draw conclusions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Primary care physicians (PCP) are filling expanded roles within oral health care to secure strong overall health for their patients. Methods: This comparative case study examines the roles of PCPs at 5 federally qualified health centers that have integrated oral health care and primary care. Administrative data were obtained directly from the Health Resources and Services Administration. Key informant interviews were performed with administrators and clinical care team members at each of the health centers. Data were reviewed by 2 experts in oral health to identify emerging roles for physicians. Results: PPCPs' roles in health centers' integration models vary, but 3 distinct roles emerged: (1) the physician as a champion, (2) the physician as a collaborator, and (3) the physician as a member of an interprofessional team. In addition, providing physicians with the necessary training to identify oral health issues was critical to preparing physicians to take on expanded roles in integrated health care delivery models. Conclusions: Regardless of the roles that they play, family physicians can contribute a great deal to the success of integration models.\", 'Aim: The major objectives of this study were to evaluate the existing pediatrics health care service provisions and utilizations of the public polyclinics in Barbados. Furthermore, the aim was to assess if the existing manpower resources were adequate. Background: Barbados has a mixed health care system consisting of both a socialized and a private health care system. The Ministry of Health commissioned a needs assessment survey of the pediatrics primary health care at the public polyclinics. Methods: Primary data were collected through interviews with the public primary health care providers. Secondary data were collected from the Barbados Census Data and Ministry of Health statistics. Data were analyzed to assess the pediatrics primary health care service utilization and adequacy of existing resources at the polyclinics. Findings: In 2012, there were 62 934 visits from children < 16 years of age to the public polyclinics in Barbados and this accounted for 39.1% of all visits (both adults and children) to the polyclinics. An overall 16.7% of the visits were from children less than five years old to the Well Child Clinic for immunization and for growth and development monitoring; 32% of all physician consultations at the polyclinics were for children < 16 years. Utilization of health services by children at the polyclinics was 5245 visits/month. Given an expected monthly demand for 10 822 visits from children, the polyclinics serve 48.5% of the primary health care demand for children in Barbados. Conclusions: The public polyclinics play a pivotal role in the pluralistic primary health care system in Barbados. They fulfill nearly half of all the primary care demand and more importantly provides for almost the entire immunization demand, and thereby ensuring high coverage. The existing resources, if used optimally, would reduce the long consultation time observed in this setting, and thereby increase the capacity considerably.', \"A visit to the dental clinic may be challenging for a child with Down syndrome due to medical and oral health problems as well as communication problems. The aim of the present study was to explore how parents of children with Down syndrome describe their child's needs in the dental health care setting. In a survey concerning parental experiences with dental health care in Sweden, free comments were analysed with content analysis and resulted in five categories: Need for continuity of care in dental health care; Need for dental health care professionals to have knowledge and expertise in caring for children with Down syndrome and other disabilities; Need for dental health care professionals to use a caring approach with children with Down syndrome; Need for the child with Down syndrome to be prepared to participate in their dental health care visit and Need for the child with Down syndrome to be given the same rights as typically developing children. To support children with Down syndrome in an optimal way, dental health care needs to be tailored to meet the child's unique needs. In addition, dental health care professionals need knowledge of and expertise in the care of children with Down syndrome.\", \"Objective To examine health status and health care experiences of homeless patients in health centers and to compare them with their nonhomeless counterparts. Data Sources/Study Setting Nationally representative data from the 2009 Health Center Patient Survey. Study Design Cross-sectional analyses were limited to adults (n=2,683). We compared sociodemographic characteristics, health conditions, access to health care, and utilization of services among homeless and nonhomeless patients. We also examined the independent effect of homelessness on health care access and utilization, as well as factors that influenced homeless patients' health care experiences. Data Collection Computer-assisted personal interviews were conducted with health center patients. Principal Findings Homeless patients had worse health statuslifetime burden of chronic conditions, mental health problems, and substance use problemscompared with housed respondents. In adjusted analyses, homeless patients had twice the odds as housed patients of having unmet medical care needs in the past year (OR=1.98, 95 percent CI: 1.243.16) and twice the odds of having an ED visit in the past year (OR=2.00, 95 percent CI: 1.372.92). Conclusions There is an ongoing need to focus on the health issues that disproportionately affect homeless populations. Among health center patients, homelessness is an independent risk factor for unmet medical needs and ED use.\", \"Background: Easy access to palliative care is one of the basic needs of cancer patients, and this can be achieved by providing such services at the community level. One approach to provide community-based palliative care is to integrate it with primary health care (PHC). Considering the antiquity and extension of the PHC system in Iran and the importance of being aware of stakeholders' views in order to integrate a palliative care provision model into a country's health care system, we aimed to explain health care providers' perception of the integration of palliative care with PHC. Methods: The present qualitative research was conducted using the conventional content analysis method in Iran from October 2016 to July 2020. The participants of the study included the stakeholders involved in providing palliative care to cancer patients, as well as PHC system experts. The participants were selected purposefully using the snowball sampling method. Data were collected through holding 21 semi-structured interviews and one focused group session and analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results: Qualitative data analysis revealed three main categories and ten subcategories. The main categories included the health system's structure as an opportunity (with the subcategories of employing the network system for providing health services, establishment of a referral system, and establishment of the family physician program and manpower diversity), requirements (with the subcategories of the position of home care centers and their relationship with PHC, opioid use management, equipment management, financial support, and legal issues), and outcomes (with the subcategories of facilitated access to services and good death). Conclusion: Iran's health system possesses adequate infrastructure for providing palliative care to cancer patients within the context of PHC. Beside available opportunities, there are also problems that need to be resolved so that families can meet their patients' care needs and provide them with an easy death by having access to home-based palliative care.\", 'Aim: Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) are primary care clinics certified through Medicare and Medicaid to provide health care to the medically underserved in rural areas of the United States. The purpose of this paper is to describe how the characteristics of RHCs have either changed or remained stable over a 10-year period in the past: from the late 1990s to 2007. In addition, it is also to describe some of the outstanding needs of RHCs as they navigate the transitions of U.S. health care reform. Methods: Using a panel of RHCs continuously in existence from 2006 through 2007, we calculated and compared statistics with corresponding statistics from the literature. We described the geographic distribution of RHCs, demographics of their counties of location, and characteristics of RHC structure and staffing. We also explored the implications of the recently enacted health reform law (the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or ACA) for RHCs, and the improvements that RHCs need as it is implemented. Findings: By the end of the study period, the highest percentages of RHCs were in the South and Midwest, the percentage of RHCs in the West had grown, and that in the South had declined. RHCs served counties with increasing proportions of individuals below poverty and Hispanics/Latinos. The percentage of independent clinics had grown, as had the percentage of for-profit clinics. Finally, the percentage of nurse practitioner full-time equivalents had grown as a proportion of the total for three providers. Conclusions: In investigating the performance of RHCs, many managerial and operational factors are not well understood. It is imperative that RHCs gather the information that could help them maximize the elements of their performance that would keep them financially stable. In addition, a broader awareness of the unique challenges that RHCs face in this era of health care reform is needed.', 'Introduction: Many families enroll their infants and toddlers in early education and child care programs. The Pennsylvania Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics recruited 32 child care centers that care for infants and toddlers to be linked with a child care health consultant (CCHC). Method: Project staff assigned the centers alternately to an immediate intervention or a 1-year delayed intervention (contrast) group. At entry into the project, and then 1 and 2 years later, an evaluator assessed center compliance with 13 standards for infants and toddler care selected from Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards (3rd ed.). Project staff linked the Immediate Intervention centers with a CCHC in Year 1. In Year 2, in a crossover comparison, project staff linked Contrast centers with a CCHC. Results: Working with a CCHC effectively improved compliance with some selected health and safety standards.', 'Background: Patients with obesity are at risk for treatment avoidance and nonadherence. Factors that contribute to engagement in primary health care for patients with obesity are not fully understood. Aim: The purpose of this pilot study was to identify issues associated with engagement in primary health care for patients with obesity. Method: Using qualitativemethodology, 11 patients with a mean body mass index of 40.8 kg/m(2) registered with a primary health care practice were interviewed. Conventional content analysis was used to identify factors that contribute to engagement in primary health care. Results: Barriers and facilitators to engagement in primary health care were categorized into the following themes: availability of resources, importance of the relationship, meaningful communication, feeling judged, lack of privacy, poor communication and limited provider knowledge about obesity. Conclusion: Obesity was identified as a health condition that requires additional considerations for patient engagement in their health care.', 'This paper discusses the role of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) in identifying and solving problems within the health care industry. It reviews current AHCPR activities and details the results of the Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey, the recent poll of how people in the United States make choices about health care. A discussion of present quality measurement tools, such as CONQUEST, a database of existing performance measures, includes an outline of plans for developing new measures of quality and outcomes. Also explored are ideas for improving quality measurements, potential problems and risks, and the public role in health services research.', 'Background: After an organizational transformation in the mid-1990s, the quality of care in the Veterans Affairs health-care system (VA) compared favorably with the quality of care in some private-sector settings. Whether this performance advantage has persisted, and also its relation to geographic and socioeconomic variations in care, is unknown. Objective: We compared the quality and equity of care for older adults in the VA with that delivered in Medicare Advantage (MA) health plans using the same performance measures. Research Design: Cross-sectional comparison. Subjects: A total of 293,554 observations from enrollees in 142 VA medical centers (VAMCs) and 5,768,573 observations from enrollees in 305 MA plans. Measurements: Adherence to quality measures assessing diabetes, cardiovascular, and cancer screening care from 2000 to 2007. Results: The VA outperformed MA plans on 10 of 11 quality measures in the initial study year, and on all 12 measures in the final year. In 2006 and 2007, adjusted differences between the VA and MA ranged from 4.3 percentage points (95% CI, 3.2-5.4) for cholesterol testing in coronary heart disease to 30.8 percentage points (95% CI, 28.1-33.5) for colorectal cancer screening. For 9 of 12 measures, socioeconomic disparities (defined as the difference in performance rates between persons in the highest and lowest quartiles of area-level income and education) were lower in the VA than in MA. Across all measures, the mean interquartile range of performance was 6.7 percentage points for VAMCs and 14.5 percentage points for MA plans. Conclusions: Among persons aged 65 years or older, the VA health-care system significantly outperformed private-sector MA plans and delivered care that was less variable by site, geographic region, and socioeconomic status.', 'Background: In Hungary, since 1990, each government has tried to transform and rationalize the structure of health care. One of the reforms was the Care Managing Organization (CMO) programme introduced in 1999. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to describe the regional, environmental, structural and preliminary health related outcomes of the CMO in Bacs-Kiskun County (Central-Eastern Hungary). Methods: First, cardiovascular screening programmes were organized for pre-screened and randomly selected populations of a total of 4462 persons. Seven years after completing the programmes, regional mortality data were analysed and compared. Second, nutritional and lifestyle counselling programmes with increased physical activity were organized for 2489 overweight or obese patients from the participating primary care practices. Anthropometric and laboratory data were examined after one and two years. Results: First, for persons with higher cardiovascular risk, appropriate medical treatment was introduced, and after seven years, their mortality rates proved better than the regional and national data. Second, almost all measured anthropometric parameters improved (body mass index, body weight decrease) after the first year and this trend lasted till the end of the second year. Conclusions: According to the data of the National Health Insurance Fund, the average savings rate for all CMOs for the fiscal years 1999-2007 was 4.94%. The highest rates of savings were realized in chronic and acute inpatient care and medical devices. In the end of 2008, by which time 14 CMOs had already covered 2.1 million people, the programme was discontinued by the government, without a comprehensive evaluation of the experience and outcomes.', 'This article analyzes Dutch experiences of health care reform-in particular in primary care-with emphasis on lessons for current United States health care reforms. Recent major innovations were the introduction of private insurance based on the principles of primary care-led health care and including all citizens irrespective of their financial, employment, or health status; introduction of primary care collaboratives for out-of-hour services and chronic disease management; and primary care team building, including practice nurses. These innovations were introduced on top of a strong primary care tradition of family practices with defined populations based on patient panels, practice-based research, evidence-based medicine, large-scale computerization, and strong primary care health informatics. Dutch health reform redirected payment to support introduction of innovative health plans and strengthening of primary care to respond to public health objectives. Five recommendations for US primary care follow from this Dutch experience: (1) a private insurance model is compatible with thriving primary care, but it must include all people, especially the most vulnerable in society, and espouse a primary care-led health care system; (2) patient panels or practice lists strengthen continuity of care and community orientation to focus on and respond to local needs; (3) reward collaboration within primary care and between primary care, hospital care, and public health; (4) stimulate primary care professionals to exert their passion and expertise through participation in primary care research and development; and (5) health informatics should be primary care based, preferably adopting the International Classification of Primary Care. With these recommendations, it will be possible for the United States to obtain better population health for its population. (J Am Board Fam Med 2012;25:S12-17.)', 'Background: While religious involvement is associated with improvements in health, little is known about the relationship between church participation and health care practices. Objectives: To determine 1) the prevalence of church participation; 2) whether church participation influences positive health care practices; and 3) whether gender, age, insurance status, and levels of comorbidity modified these relationships. Design: A cross-sectional analysis using survey data from 2196 residents of a low-income, African-American neighborhood. Measurements: Our independent variable measured the frequency of church attendance. Dependent variables were: 1) Pap smear; 2) mammogram; and 3) dental visit-all taking place within 2 years; 4) blood pressure measurement within 1 year, 5) having a regular source of care, and 6) no perceived delays in care in the previous year. We controlled for socioeconomic factors and the number of comorbid conditions and also tested for interactions. Results: Thirty-seven percent of community members went to church at least monthly. Church attendance was associated with increased likelihood of positive health care practices by 20% to 80%. In multivariate analyses, church attendance was related to dental visits (odds ratio [OR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3 to 1.9) and blood pressure measurements (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.1). Insurance status and number of comorbid conditions modified the relationship between church attendance and Pap smear, with increased practices noted for the uninsured (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.1) and for women with 2 or more comorbid conditions (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5). Conclusion: Church attendance is an important correlate of positive health care practices, especially for the most vulnerable subgroups, the uninsured and chronically ill. Community- and faith-based organizations present additional opportunities to improve the health of low-income and minority populations.', \"Although many health care reforms have been enacted in the last few years in Germany, many of the key points in the current social health care system have been retained from former times. All those introductions for an effective health care system from the last 150 years beginning with mandatory guild membership via Bismarck's social laws to the modern health care systems in Germany with the current problems of financing the heavy burden in the German budget are reported. Data and facts on the current health care system are provided. In the following two articles of this series ambulatory and inpatient treatment in the light of economic aspects of health care are reported.\", 'We examined racial/ethnic disparities in unmet specialty, dental, mental, and allied health care needs among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) using data on 38,866 children in the National Survey of CSHCN. Compared with White CSHCN, Black CSHCN had significantly greater unmet specialty (9.6% vs. 6.7%), dental (16% vs. 8.7%), and mental (27% vs. 17%) health care needs. Hispanic CSHCN had greater unmet dental care needs (15.8% vs. 8.7%). Black females had greater unmet mental health care needs than other groups (41% vs. 13-20%). Most disparities disappeared after multivariate adjustment. Significant risk factors for unmet health care needs included uninsurance, having no personal doctor/nurse, poverty, and condition stability and severity. Eliminating unmet specialty, dental, and mental health care needs for all CSHCN, and especially minority CSHCN, may require greater efforts to reduce poverty and increase insurance coverage among CSHCN, better mental health care assessment of Black female CSHCN, and ensuring all CSHCN have a medical home.', \"This study intends to map the health care given to the usuary with needs in the mental health field in a primary health care unity, analyzing the team work in the light of the integrate primary health care practices. The participants are health workers from different professions, who belong to the service's mental health working processes. The data collection technique used was the analytic flowchart. The results show us that the connective flows among the professionals and between them and the health unity's, in the primary health care unit, has been producing and proliferated diverse exchanges' spaces, making possible health actions aligned to the integrality in people's care through a enlarged understanding of health mental disease process, by means of human relationships' valuation and subjectivities involved in the health work space.\", \"Purpose: To examine unmet health needs and health care utilization among youth with special health care needs (YSHCN). Methods: We analyzed data among youth aged 12-17 years using the 2016 National Survey of Children's Health. We conducted descriptive analyses comparing YSHCN with non-YSHCN, and bivariate and multivariable analyses examining associations between dependent and independent measures. Six dependent variables represented unmet needs and utilization. Adjusted analyses controlled for sociodemographic and health measures. Results: A total of 5,862 individuals were identified as YSHCN, and nearly 70% had three or more comorbid conditions. Over 90% used medical care, preventive care, or dental care in the past 12 months, while 8% reported having unmet health needs (compared with 2.8% of non-YSHCN). Using a typology of qualifying criteria for special health care needs, we found that YSHCN with increasing complexity of needs were more likely to report unmet health needs, use of mental health care services, and emergency department use, compared with YSHCN using medication only to manage their conditions. All YSHCN living in households below 400% federal poverty level were less likely to utilize nearly all types of health care examined, with the exception of mental health care use, compared with those at or above 400% federal poverty level. Conclusions: Differences in complexity of needs, race/ethnicity, and poverty status highlight existing gaps in health care utilization and persistent unmet health needs among YSHCN. Efforts should focus on strengthening coordinated systems of care that optimally meet the needs of YSHCN so they may thrive in their families and communities.

Objective: To describe the reproductive health diagnoses of women Veterans using VA health care, how these diagnoses differ across age groups, and variations in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics by presence of reproductive health diagnoses. Research Design: This study is a cross-sectional analysis of VA administrative and clinical data. Subjects: The study included women Veterans using VA health care in FY10. Measures: Reproductive health diagnoses were identified through presence of International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision (ICD-9) codes in VA clinical and administrative records. The prevalence of specific diagnosis categories were examined by age group (18-44, 45-64, >= 65 y) and the most frequent diagnoses for each age group were identified. Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were compared by presence of at least 1 reproductive health diagnosis. Results: The most frequent reproductive health diagnoses were menstrual disorders and endometriosis among those aged 18-44 years (n = 16,658, 13%), menopausal disorders among those aged 45-64 years (n = 20,707, 15%), and osteoporosis among those aged >= 65 years (n = 8365, 22%). Compared with women without reproductive health diagnoses, those with such diagnoses were more likely to have concomitant mental health (46% vs. 37%, P < 0.001) and medical conditions (75% vs. 63%, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Women Veterans using VA health care have diverse reproductive health diagnoses. The high prevalence of comorbid medical and mental health conditions among women Veterans with reproductive health diagnoses highlights the importance of integrating reproductive health expertise into all areas of VA health care, including primary, mental health, and specialty care.', 'Objectives:Identifying routinely recorded markers of poor health in patients with dementia may help treatment decisions and evaluation of earlier outcomes in research. Our objective was to determine whether a set of credible markers of dementia-related health could be identified from primary care electronic health records (EHR). Methods:The study consisted of (i) rapid review of potential measures of dementia-related health used in EHR studies; (ii) consensus exercise to assess feasibility of identifying these markers in UK primary care EHR; (iii) development of UK EHR code lists for markers; (iv) analysis of a regional primary care EHR database to determine further potential markers; (v) consensus exercise to finalise markers and pool into higher domains; (vi) determination of 12-month prevalence of domains in EHR of 2328 patients with dementia compared to matched patients without dementia. Results:Sixty-three markers were identified and mapped to 13 domains: Care; Home Pressures; Severe Neuropsychiatric; Neuropsychiatric; Cognitive Function; Daily Functioning; Safety; Comorbidity; Symptoms; Diet/Nutrition; Imaging; Increased Multimorbidity; Change in Dementia Drug. Comorbidity was the most prevalent recorded domain in dementia (69%). Home Pressures were the least prevalent domain (1%). Ten domains had a statistically significant higher prevalence in dementia patients, one (Comorbidity) was higher in non-dementia patients, and two (Home Pressures, Diet/Nutrition) showed no association with dementia. Conclusions:EHR captures important markers of dementia-related health. Further research should assess if they indicate dementia progression. These markers could provide the basis for identifying individuals at risk of faster progression and outcome measures for use in research.', 'Objective Data Sources/Study Setting Examine how behavioral health (BH) integration affects health care costs, emergency department (ED) visits, and inpatient admissions. Truven Health MarketScan Research Databases. Study Design Data Collection/Extraction Methods Social network analysis identified care communities (providers sharing a high number of patients) and measured BH integration in terms of how connected, or central, BH providers were to other providers in their community. Multivariable generalized linear models adjusting for age, sex, number of prescriptions, and Charlson comorbidity score were used to estimate the relationship between the centrality of BH providers and health care utilization of BH patients. Used outpatient, inpatient, and pharmacy claims data from six Medicaid plans from 2011 to 2013 to identify study outcomes, comorbidities, providers, and health care encounters. Principal Findings Conclusions Behavioral health centrality ranged from 0 (no BH providers) to 0.49. Relative to communities at the median BH centrality (0.06), in 2012, BH patients in communities at the 75th percentile of BH centrality (0.31) had 0.2 fewer admissions, 2.1 fewer all-cause ED visits, and accrued $1,947 fewer costs, on average. Increased behavioral centrality was significantly associated with a reduced number of ED visits, less frequent inpatient admissions, and lower overall health care costs.', 'Background. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine commissioned an environmental scan describing the status of health care integration of oral health and primary care services. Methods. The authors conducted an environmental scan of US integration activities with publications from January 2000 through August 2017. They categorized services as preventive oral health services (POHS) provided by medical care providers, POHS provided by dental providers in nondental settings, preventive health services provided by dental providers, or care coordination using dedicated personnel and technology. The authors chose 4 programs as case studies and interviewed key personnel in each program. One case study illustrates each category of integrated services; additional examples describe category variation. Results. The case study involving Into the Mouth of Babes illustrates medical professionals delivering POHS to children. The case study involving Grace Health presents dental hygienists embedded in the obstetrics-gynecology clinic to provide oral screening, prophylaxis, and education to pregnant women. At HealthPartners, medical care providers refer patients with diabetes to dentists and waive copays for periodontal care. The InterCommunity Health Network Coordinated Care Organization uses dedicated patient coordinators, technology, and coordinated payment and referral mechanisms to facilitate care. Conclusions. Integration of dental and medical care increased access to and coordination of patient care by means of offering health care services traditionally provided by the other profession. Practical Implications. Integration models demonstrate the incorporation of POHS by primary care professionals, the embedding of dental professionals into primary care clinics, and the incorporation of care coordination to increase the delivery of oral health care. Similarly, dentists identify and refer patients with medical needs or preventive gaps to medical homes.', 'To obtain information about the actual use of health care facilities by undocumented women and to identify obstacles they experience in accessing health care facilities. A mixed methods study, with structured questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, was chosen to obtain a complete understanding. One-hundred undocumented women were recruited. Diversity was sought according to age, origin and reason for being undocumented. Undocumented female immigrants have unmet health care needs (56%) and low health care utilisation. Sixty-nine per cent of the women reported obstacles in accessing health care facilities. These included many personal obstacles such as shame, fear and/or lack of information. Poor language proficiency (OR 0.28;. CI 0.09-0.90) reduces utilisation of primary health care services. Health care utilisation of undocumented women is low. Undocumented women refrain from seeking health care because of personal obstacles. These women need to be identified and informed about their rights, the health care system and the duty of professional confidentiality of doctors. Finally, institutional obstacles to access care should be removed since they strengthen reluctance to seek help.', 'Background: Advance care planning (ACP) is recommended for all persons to ensure that the care they receive aligns with their values and preferences. Objective: To evaluate an ACP intervention developed to better meet the needs and priorities of persons with chronic diseases, including mild cognitive impairment. Research Design: A year-long, pre-post intervention using lay community health workers [care coordinator assistants (CCAs)] trained to conduct and document ACP conversations with patients during home health visits with pre-post evaluation. Subjects: The 818 patients were 74.2 years old (mean); 78% women; 51% African American; 43% white. Measures: Documentation of ACP conversation in electronic health record fields and health care utilization outcomes. Results: In this target population ACP documentation rose from 3.4% (pre-CCA training) to 47.9% (post) of patients who had at least 1 discussion about ACP in the electronic health record. In the 1-year preintervention period, there were no differences in admissions, emergency department (ED) visits, and outpatient visits between patients who did and did not have ACP discussion. After adjusting for prior hospitalization and ED use histories, ACP discussions were associated with a 34% less probability of hospitalization (hazard ratios, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.97), and similar effects are apparent on ED use independent of age and prior ED use effects. Conclusions: Patients with chronic diseases including mild cognitive impairment can engage in ACP conversations with trusted home health care providers. Having ACP conversation is associated with significant reduction in seeking urgent health care and in hospitalizations.', \"We review recently published studies of U.S. health policy and the nation's health care system. Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, health inequalities were widening and care was inequitably distributed. Although the Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion improved access to care and timely cancer diagnoses, a large proportion of U.S. residents continued to avoid medical care due to concerns about costs, and access to mental health services remains particularly inadequate. Yet more evidence of private insurers' profit-driven misbehaviors and of corruption among medical leaders continues to emerge. Misguided incentives and lax regulation encourages nominally nonprofit health care providers to mimic for-profits' misconduct, and rapacious investors own and control an increasing share of physicians' practices. Pharmaceutical firms wield outsize political influence and devote far more funds to rewarding investors than to research and development effort. Yet despite vigorous efforts by pharma and other commercial interests to denigrate national health insurance, polls indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increasing support for such reform.\", \"Background: Informal (dementia) care has economic consequences throughout the health care system. Whilst the health and wellbeing of the care recipient might improve, the health of the caregiver might also change, typically for the worse. Therefore, this analysis aims to examine the association between caregiving intensity and caregivers' health and health care utilization. Data and Methods: The empirical analysis is based on cross-sectional survey data generated by the European Project RightTimePlaceCare (RTPC). RTPC was a prospective cohort study conducted in eight European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom). The health status of 1029 informal caregivers was assessed by measures of psychological wellbeing (GHQ-12) and self-rated overall health (EQ-VAS). Health care utilization was measured by (i) the self-stated proportion of health care use influenced by caregiving and (ii) the probability of at least one visit to a general practitioner within in the last 30 days. The association between caregiving intensity and caregivers' health and health care utilization was assessed by descriptive analysis and multivariate OLS- and probit-models. Results: A higher amount of informal care was significantly related to negative health outcomes for informal caregivers. On average, one additional hour of informal caregiving per day was associated with a decrease of psychological wellbeing and self-rated overall health by 0.16 and 0.42 index points respectively. Furthermore, one more hour of informal caregiving corresponded with increased self-stated proportion of health care use by 0.56 percentage points. However, the claim of increased health care demand due to caregiving as measured by GP visits was only partly confirmed. Conclusion: When evaluating the full economic effect of informal care, the impact of providing care on caregivers' health and health care utilization has to be taken into account.

Methods We linked 1,459 community-dwelling women (mean age 83.6 years) participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Year 16 visit (2002-2004) with their Medicare claims. Five dimensions of sleep health (satisfaction, daytime sleepiness, timing, latency, and duration) were assessed by self-report. The number of impaired dimensions was expressed as a score (range 0-5). Total direct health-care costs and utilization were ascertained during the subsequent 36 months. Results Mean (SD) total health-care costs/year (2017 dollars) increased in a graded manner across the sleep health score ranging from $10,745 ($15,795) among women with no impairment to up to $15,332 ($22,810) in women with impairment in three to five dimensions (p = 0.01). After adjustment for age, race, and enrollment site, women with impairment in three to five dimensions vs. no impairment had greater mean total costs (cost ratio [CR] 1.34 [95% CI = 1.13 to 1.60]) and appeared to be at higher risk of hospitalization (odds ratio (OR) 1.31 [95% CI = 0.96 to 1.81]). After further accounting for number of medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms, impairment in three to five sleep health dimensions was not associated with total costs (CR 1.02 [95% CI = 0.86 to 1.22]) or hospitalization (OR 0.91 [95% CI = 0.65 to 1.28]). Poor multidimensional sleep health was not related to outpatient costs or risk of skilled nursing facility stay. Conclusions Older women with poor sleep health have higher subsequent total health-care costs largely attributable to their greater burden of medical conditions, functional limitations, and depressive symptoms.', 'BackgroundPrimary health care and its strengthening through performance measurement is essential for sustainably working towards universal health coverage. Existing performance frameworks and indicators to measure primary health care capture system functions like governance, financing and resourcing but to a lesser extent the function of services delivery and its heterogeneous nature. Moreover, most frameworks have weak links with routine information systems and national health priorities, especially in the context of high- and middle-income countries. This paper presents the development of a tool that responds to this context with the aim to create primary health care performance intelligence for the 53 countries of the WHO European Region.MethodsThe work builds-off of an existing systematic review on primary care and draws on priorities of current European health policies and available (inter)national information systems. Its development included: (i) reviewing and classifying features of primary care; (ii) constructing a set of tracer conditions; and (iii) mapping existing indicators in the framework resulting from (i). The analysis was validated through a series of reviews: in-person meetings with country-nominated focal points and primary care experts; at-distance expert reviews; and, preliminary testing with country informants.ResultsThe resulting framework applies a performance continuum in the classical approach of structures-processes-outcomes spanning 6 domains - primary care structures, model of primary care, care contact, primary care outputs, health system outcomes, and health outcomes - that are further classified by 26 subdomains and 63 features of primary care. A care continuum was developed using a set of 12 tracer conditions. A total of 139 indicators were mapped to the classification, each with an identified data source to safeguard measurability. Individual indicator passports and a glossary of terms were developed to support the standardization of the findings.ConclusionThe resulting framework and suite of indicators, coined the Primary Health Care Impact, Performance and Capacity Tool (PHC-IMPACT), has the potential to be applied in Europe, closing the gap on existing data collection, analysis and use of performance intelligence for decision-making towards primary health care strengthening.', \"Authors analysed materials of the WHO Conference on European Health Care Reforms, Ljubljana Slovenia, 17 - 20 June 1996. International overview of data obteined by reviewing and abstracting WHO background documentation about Analysis of Current Strategies and about Citizens Choice and Patients' Rights were presented. Epidemiological data and international comparison on the current situation in the health care systems and their prospective reforms were aimed to provide a starting point for the mutual exchange of experience among the participants of the International Conference on Bioethics Health Care under Stress in Bratislava, August 1996.\", 'Objective: To compare health behaviors, physical health outcomes, and health care utilization between children with and without ADHD. Method: In this cross-sectional study, we obtained data for children with and without ADHD from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. To investigate the association between ADHD and health outcomes, we estimated the adjusted prevalence ratios (APRs) in these groups. Results: Among 10,838 children aged 7 to 18 years with and without ADHD, those with ADHD had significantly higher APRs for overall health problems, physical illness, and injuries than those without ADHD. Despite having health care needs, children with ADHD were less likely than those without ADHD to use health care services. However, there were no significant associations between most health behaviors and ADHD. Conclusion: Increased efforts are needed to provide quality health care services to address the medical conditions of children with ADHD and to enhance their health care utilization when needed.', \"OBJECTIVES. We compared patient satisfaction among adults with diabetes treated in a Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system with the satisfaction of patients treated in a county-funded health care system. We also examined whether satisfaction differences reflected differences in the process of patient care. DESIGN. Cross-sectional telephone survey of patients recruited from outpatient clinics. SUBJECTS. Five hundred and thirty eight adults, including 310 patients from 4 VA clinics and 228 patients from 2 county clinics. MEASURES. Overall satisfaction with care and satisfaction with 6 separate dimensions of care were measured using the Employee Health Care Value Survey. RESULTS. VA patients were more satisfied than were county patients overall and with 5 of 6 dimensions of their care. These differences increased when we adjusted for patients' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. VA patients reported more diabetes counseling and shorter waiting times to see their doctor. Each of these self-reported process measures was positively correlated with satisfaction and, when taken into account, reduced the differences in satisfaction between the two systems. However, even when we controlled both for patient characteristics and the process of care, VA patients still were more satisfied than were county patients with their care overall as well as with their access to care, communication with providers, and the quality of their health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS. In this study, VA patients with diabetes were more satisfied with their health care than were county patients. Perceived diabetes-related counseling and shorter waiting times contributed to differences between the systems in patient satisfaction but did not explain them completely.\", 'Background: In the Netherlands, ethnic minority populations visit their general practitioner (GP) more often than the indigenous population. An explanation for this association is lacking. Recently, health literacy is suggested as a possible explaining mechanism. Internationally, associations between health literacy and health care use, and between ethnicity and health literacy have been studied separately, but, so far, have not been linked to each other. In the Netherlands, some expectations have been expressed with regard to supposed low health literacy of ethnic minority groups, however, no empirical study has been done so far. The objectives of this study are therefore to acquire insight into the level of health literacy of ethnic minorities in the Netherlands and to examine whether the relationship between ethnicity and health care use can be (partly) explained by health literacy. Methods: A questionnaire was sent to a sample of 2.116 members of the Dutch Health Care Consumer Panel (response rate 46%, 89 respondents of non-western origin). Health literacy was measured with the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ) which covers nine different domains. The health literacy levels of ethnic minority groups were compared to the indigenous population. A negative binomial regression model was used to estimate the association between ethnicity and GP visits. To examine whether health literacy is an explaining factor in this association, health literacy and interaction terms of health literacy and ethnicity were added into the model. Results: Differences in levels of health literacy were only found between the Turkish population and the indigenous Dutch population. This study also found an association between ethnicity and GP visits. Ethnic minorities visit their GP 33% more often than the indigenous population. Three domains of the HLQ (the ability to navigate the health care system, the ability to find information and to read and understand health information) partly explained the association between ethnicity and GP visits. Conclusions: In general, there are no differences in health literacy between most of the ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands and the indigenous Dutch population. Only the Turkish population scored significantly lower on several health literacy domains. Some domains of health literacy do explain the association between ethnicity and higher frequency of GP visits. Further research is recommended to understand the pathways through which health literacy impacts health care use.', \"The lockdown restrictions that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic have reshaped the way people live, work, and interact with each other. At the same time, it changed the way health-care professionals and national health-care systems around the world are fighting in this battle for public health. Social media (SoMe) have played their informational role in this fight with almost one-third of the world's population being active users of social media platforms. Contemporary health-care systems have tried to find ways to engage more actively with SoMe as Internet users are increasingly searching for health information on social media platforms. As a result, new demand-side levers arise in the health-care sector along with new opportunities and risks for the stakeholders. Our study looked into the responses of 173 health-care professionals in Greece. SoMe are here to stay and the majority of health-care professionals embrace them in their professional lives. Quality in health information and the work context of Greek health-care professionals in our cohort contribute to attitudes and perceptions of social media use in health care.\", \"Introduction: Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMADs) are the most common complication of pregnancy and have been found to have long-term implications for both mother and child. In vulnerable patient populations such as those served at Denver Health, a federally qualified health center the prevalence of PMADs is nearly double the nationally reported rate of 15-20%. Nearly 17% of women will be diagnosed with major depression at some point in their lives and those numbers are twice as high in women who live in poverty. Women also appear to be at higher risk for depression in the child-bearing years. In order to better address these issues, an Integrated Perinatal Mental Health program was created to screen, assess, and treat PMADs in alignment with national recommendations to improve maternal-child health and wellness. This program was built upon a national model of Integrated Behavioral Health already in place at Denver Health. Methods: A multidisciplinary team of physicians, behavioral health providers, public health, and administrators was assembled at Denver Health, an integrated hospital and community health care system that serves as the safety net hospital to the city and county of Denver, CO. This team was brought together to create a universal screen-to-treat process for PMAD's in perinatal clinics and to adapt the existing Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH) model into a program better suited to the health system's obstetric population. Universal prenatal and postnatal depression screening was implemented at the obstetric intake visit, a third trimester prenatal care visit, and at the postpartum visit across the clinical system. At the same time, IBH services were implemented across our health system's perinatal care system in a stepwise fashion. This included our women's care clinics as well as the family medicine and pediatric clinics. These efforts occurred in tandem to support all patients and staff enabling a specially trained behavioral health provider (psychologists and L.C.S.W.'s) to respond immediately to any positive screen during or after pregnancy. Results: In August 2014 behavioral health providers were integrated into the women's care clinics. In January 2015 universal screening for PMADs was implemented throughout the perinatal care system. Screening has improved from 0% of women screened at the obstetric care intake visit in August 2014 to >75% of women screened in August 2016. IBH coverage by a licensed psychologist or licensed clinical social worker exists in 100% of perinatal clinics as of January 2016. As well, in order to gain sustainability, the ability to bill same day visits as well as to bill, and be reimbursed for screening and assessment visits, continues to improve and provide for a model that is self-sustaining for the future. Conclusion: Implementation of a universal screening process for PMADs alongside the development of an IBH model in perinatal care has led to the creation of a program that is feasible and has the capacity to serve as a national model for improving perinatal mental health in vulnerable populations.\", 'Introduction: We investigated the size profile of US primary care and behavioral health physician practices since size may impact the ability to institute care management processes (CMPs) that can enhance care quality. Method: We utilized 2009 claims data from a nationwide commercial insurer to estimate practice size by linking providers by tax identification number. We determined the proportion of primary care physicians, psychiatrists, and behavioral health providers practicing in venues of > 20 providers per practice (the lower bound for current CMP practice surveys). Results: Among primary care physicians (n = 350,350), only 2.1% of practices consisted of > 20 providers. Among behavioral health practitioners (n = 146,992) and psychiatrists (n = 44,449), 1.3% and 1.0% of practices, respectively, had > 20 providers. Sensitivity analysis excluding single-physician practices as secondary confirmed findings, with primary care and psychiatrist practices of > 20 providers comprising, respectively, only 19.4% and 8.8% of practices (difference: P < 0.0001). In secondary analyses, bipolar disorder was used as a tracer condition to estimate practice census for a high-complexity, high-cost behavioral health condition; only 1.3-18 patients per practice had claims for this condition. Conclusions: The tax identification number method for estimating practice size has strengths and limitations that complement those of survey methods. The proportion of practices below the lower bound of prior CMP studies is substantial, and care models and policies will need to address the needs of such practices and their patients. Achieving a critical mass of patients for disorder-specific CMPs will require coordination across multiple small practices.', 'In the past 2 decades, societal spending on health care has become an international concern. The United States currently spends more than 1.6 trillion dollars per year on health care approximately 15% of the gross domestic product. The provision of care to critically ill patients accounts for a disproportionate share of these health care dollars-approximately 13% of hospital costs, 4% of national health expenditures, and 0.5% to 1% of the gross domestic product. This enormous investment necessitates careful evaluation of our interventions and their associated expense. Economic evaluation can aid policy makers and health care professionals in comparing the relative and incremental value of disparate and expensive therapies and also inform decisions about which interventions provide good value for the health care dollar. In this review, we will highlight landmark publications over the past 3 decades that have helped to shape the field of economic evaluation for critical care medicine.', 'There is a need for a paradigm shift across mental health in primary care to improve the lives of millions of Europeans. To contribute to this paradigm shift, the European Forum for Primary Care (EFPC-MH) working group for Mental Health, produced a Position Paper for Primary Care Mental Health outlining 14 themes that needed prioritizing. These themes were developed and discussed interactively during the EFPC conferences between 2012 and 2019. The Position Paper on Mental Health gives direction to the necessary improvements over the next ten years. The themes vary from preferable healthcare model to the social determinants highlighting issues such as inequalities. The Statement of Mental Health in Primary Care will be established in cooperation with fellow organizations.', 'Background: Public health and primary care are distinct sectors within western health care systems. Within each sector, work is carried out in the context of organizations, for example, public health units and primary care clinics. Building on a scoping literature review, our study aimed to identify the influencing factors within these organizations that affect the ability of these health care sectors to collaborate with one another in the Canadian context. Relationships between these factors were also explored. Methods: We conducted an interpretive descriptive qualitative study involving in-depth interviews with 74 key informants from three provinces, one each in western, central and eastern Canada, and others representing national organizations, government, or associations. The sample included policy makers, managers, and direct service providers in public health and primary care. Results: Seven major organizational influencing factors on collaboration were identified: 1) Clear Mandates, Vision, and Goals; 2) Strategic Coordination and Communication Mechanisms between Partners; 3) Formal Organizational Leaders as Collaborative Champions; 4) Collaborative Organizational Culture; 5) Optimal Use of Resources; 6) Optimal Use of Human Resources; and 7) Collaborative Approaches to Programs and Services Delivery. Conclusion: While each influencing factor was distinct, the many interactions among these influences are indicative of the complex nature of public health and primary care collaboration. These results can be useful for those working to set up new or maintain existing collaborations with public health and primary care which may or may not include other organizations.', \"Introduction: In 2007, a substantial reform changed the administrative boundaries of the Danish health care system and introduced health care agreements to be signed between municipal and regional authorities. To assess the health care agreements as a tool for coordinating health and social services, a survey was conducted before (2005-2006) and after the reform (2011). Theory and methods: The study was designed on the basis of a modified version of Alter and Hage's framework for conceptualising coordination. Both surveys addressed all municipal level units (n = 271/98) and a random sample of general practitioners (n = 700/853). Results: The health care agreements were considered more useful for coordinating care than the previous health plans. The power relationship between the regional and municipal authorities in drawing up the agreements was described as more equal. Familiarity with the agreements among general practitioners was higher, as was the perceived influence of the health care agreements on their work. Discussion: Health care agreements with specific content and with regular follow-up and systematic mechanisms for organising feedback between collaborative partners exemplify a useful tool for the coordination of health and social services. Conclusion: There are substantial improvements with the new health agreements in terms of formalising a better coordination of the health care system.\", \"Background: While previous research has suggested that health care assistants supporting palliative care work in the community regard the provision of emotional labour as a key aspect of their role, little research has explored the experiences of family carers who are the recipients of such support. Objective: To explore the emotional labour undertaken by health care assistants working in community palliative care from the perspectives of both health care assistants and bereaved family carers. Design: We conducted a qualitative interview study in 2011-2012 with bereaved family carers of cancer patients who had received the services of health care assistants in the community, and health care assistants who provided community palliative care services. Transcripts were coded and analysed for emergent themes using a constant comparative technique. Settings: Three different research sites in the United Kingdom, all providing community palliative care. Participants and methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 33 bereaved family carers and eight health care assistants. Results: Health care assistants view one of their key roles as providing emotional support to patients and their family carers, and family carers recognise and value this emotional support. Emotional support by health care assistants was demonstrated in three main ways: the relationships which health care assistants developed and maintained on the professional personal boundary; the ability of health care assistants to negotiate clinical/ domestic boundaries in the home; the ways in which health care assistants and family carers worked together to enable the patient to die at home. Conclusion: Through their emotional labour, health care assistants perform an important role in community palliative care which is greatly valued by family carers. While recent reports have highlighted potential dangers in the ambiguity of their role, any attempts to clarify the 'boundaries' of the health care assistant role should acknowledge the advantages health care assistants can bring in bridging potential gaps between healthcare professionals and family carers.

It has been estimated that there were 28 million cancer survivors around the world in 2012. In the UK, for patients diagnosed in 2007, it is predicted that more than half of them will survive their cancer for 5 years or more. A large majority of cancer survivors report unmet supportive care needs and distressing symptoms and adverse long-term consequences related to their cancer. Cancer management could be optimized to better meet patients demand through technology, including mobile health (m-Health). m-Health is defined as the use of mobile communications and network technologies for health care. m-Health can help both patients and health-care professionals and play an important part in managing and delivering cancer care including managing side effects, supporting drug adherence, providing cancer information, planning and follow up and detecting and diagnosing cancer. Health authorities have already published guidelines regulating m-Health to insure patient safety and improve the accountability of its applications.', 'Objective: For patients with an initial primary care (PC) encounter in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) that included a mental health diagnosis, we evaluate whether same-day receipt of Primary Care-Mental Health Integration (PC-MHI) services is associated with the likelihood of receiving a subsequent mental-health-related encounter in the following 90 days. Method: Using VHA administrative data, we identified 9046 patients who received VHA care for the first time in fiscal year 2009, received a PC encounter that included a mental health diagnosis on the first day of their VHA services and initiated care at a VHA facility that provided PC-MHI services. Using multivariable generalized estimating equations logistic regression, we examined whether receipt of same-day PC-MHI was associated with receipt of a subsequent encounter with a mental health diagnosis within 90 days. Analyses adjusted for Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Veteran status, demographic characteristics, service-connected disability, psychiatric and non-psychiatric diagnoses, and psychotropic medication initiation on the index day of service use. Results: Receipt of same-day PC-MHI services was positively associated with having a mental-health-related encounter in the following 90 days (adjusted odds ratio=2.05; 95% confidence interval=1.66-2.54). Conclusions: PC-MHI services may enhance mental health continuation of care among PC patients with mental health conditions who initiate VHA services. Published by Elsevier Inc.', \"This study reports on a statewide survey of medical and behavioral health professionals to advance the knowledge base on the benefits and obstacles to delivering integrated pediatric health care. Surveys distributed in 3 statewide provider networks were completed by 110 behavioral health specialists (BHSs) and 111 primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey content documented their perceptions about key services, benefits, barriers, and needed opportunities related to integrated care. Factor analyses identified 8 factors, and other items were examined individually. We compared responses by specialty group (BHS vs PCP) and integrated care experience (no vs yes). The findings revealed differences across domains by specialty subgroup. In several cases, BHS (vs PCP) respondents, especially those with integrated care experience, reported lower benefits, higher barriers, and fewer resource requests. The implications of these results for enhancing care integration development, delivery, training, and research are discussed along with the study's limitations and empirical literature.\", 'Evidence of the health-promoting influence of primary care has been accumulating ever since researchers have been able to distinguish primary care from other aspects of the health services delivery system. This evidence shows that primary care helps prevent illness and death, regardless of whether the care is characterized by supply of primary care physicians, a relationship with a source of primary care, or the receipt of important features of primary care. The evidence also shows that primary care (in contrast to specialty care) is associated with a more equitable distribution of health in populations, a finding that holds in both cross-national and within-national studies. The means by which primary care improves health have been identified, thus suggesting ways to improve overall health and reduce differences in health across major population subgroups.', \"Accountable care organizations (ACOs) and hospitals are investing in improving !'population health, by which they nearly always mean the health of the population of patients attributed by Medicare, Medicaid, or private health insurers to their organizations. But population health can and should also mean the health of the entire population in a geographic area. We present arguments for and against ACOs and hospitals investing in affecting the socioeconomic determinants of health to improve the health of the population in their geographic area, and we provide examples of ACOs and hospitals that are doing so in a limited way. These examples suggest that ACOs and hospitals can work with other organizations in their community to improve population health. We briefly present recent proposals for such coalitions and for how they could be financed to be sustainable.\", \"Objective. The absence of a more significant improvement in cancer survival in countries such as the UK and Denmark may be partly rooted in delayed care-seeking among cancer patients. Past research on patient delay has mainly focused on patient characteristics (e. g. sociodemographic and psychological factors and symptom recognition) as causes of delayed care-seeking, while few studies have examined how the organizational structure of health care systems may influence patients' reflections on seeking care. The aim of this study was to explore this relationship. Design. The analysis presented is based on semi-structured interviews with 30 cancer patients and their families. Results. The article raises two hypotheses on the relationship between structural elements of a health care system and people's reflections on seeking health care: (1) Gatekeeping introduces an asymmetrical relationship between the patient and the GP which potentially results in self-restricting care-seeking, (2) Continuity in the doctor-patient relationship may negatively influence patient reflections on access to health care, as the focus shifts from the medical issues of the consultation to reflections on how to properly interact with the GP and the system in which she/he is situated. Conclusion. It is concluded that these hypotheses form a sound basis for further primary care research on how the organizational structure of health care systems influences patient reflections on access to medical care.\", \"Children with medical complexity have high health service utilization and health expenditures that can impose significant financial burdens. This study examined these issues for families with children enrolled in US private health plans. Using IBM Watson/Truven Analytics MarketScan (R) commercial claims and encounters data (2012-2014), we analyzed through regression models, the differences in health care utilization and spending of disaggregated health care services by health plan types and children's medical complexity levels. Children in consumer-driven and high-deductible plans had much higher out-of-pocket spending and cost shares than those in health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations (PPOs). Children with complex chronic conditions had higher service utilization and out-of-pocket expenditures while having lower cost shares on various categories of services than those without any chronic condition. Compared to families covered by PPOs, those with high-deductible or consumer-driven plans were 2.7 and 1.7 times more likely to spend over US$1000 out of pocket on their children's medical care, respectively. Families with higher complexity levels were more likely to experience financial burdens from expenditures on children's medical services. In conclusion, policymakers and families with children need to be cognizant of the significant financial burdens that can arise from children's complex medical needs and health plan demand-side cost sharing.\", \"Objective To explore why and how health systems are engaging in care delivery redesign (CDR)-defined as the variety of tools and organizational change processes health systems use to pursue the Triple Aim. Study Setting A purposive sample of 24 health systems across 4 states as part of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's Comparative Health System Performance Initiative. Study Design An exploratory qualitative study design to gain an on the ground understanding of health systems' motivations for, and approaches to, CDR, with the goals of identifying key dimensions of CDR, and gauging the depth of change that is possible based on the particular approaches to redesign care being adopted by the health systems. Data Collection Semi-structured telephone interviews with health system executives and physician organization leaders from 24 health systems (n = 162). Principal Findings We identify and define 13 CDR activities and find that the health systems' efforts are varied in terms of both the combination of activities they are engaging in and the depth of innovation within each activity. Health system executives who report strong internal motivation for their CDR efforts describe more confidence in their approach to CDR than those who report strong external motivation. Health system leaders face uncertainty when implementing CDR due to a limited evidence base and because of the slower than expected pace of payment change. Conclusions The ability to validly and reliably measure CDR activities-particularly across varying organizational contexts and markets-is currently limited but is key to better understanding CDR's impact on intended outcomes, which is important for guiding both health system decision making and policy making.\", \"Background: Maternal mental health problems affect up to 20% of women, with potentially deleterious effects to the mother and family. To address this serious problem, a Maternal Mental Health Program (MMHP) using a shared care approach was developed. Ashared care approach can promote an efficient use of limited specialized maternal mental health services, strengthen collaboration between the maternal mental health care team and primary care physicians, increase access to maternal mental health care services, and promote primary care provider competence in treating maternal mental health problems. Aim: The purpose of this research was to evaluate the impact of a MMHP using a shared care approach on maternal anxiety and depression symptoms of participants, the satisfaction of women and referring physicians, and whether the program met the intents of shared care approach (such as quick consultation, increased knowledge, and confidence of primary care physicians). Methods: We used a pre and post cross-sectional study design to evaluate women's depression and anxiety symptoms and the satisfaction of women and their primary care health provider with the program. Findings: Depression and anxiety symptoms significantly improved with involvement with the program. Women and physicians reported high levels of satisfaction with the program. Physician knowledge and confidence treating maternal mental health problems improved. Conclusions: Shared care can be an effective and efficient way to provide maternal mental health care in primary health care settings where resources are limited.\", 'We consider an economy where most of the health care is publicly provided, and where there is waiting time for several types of treatments. Private health care without waiting time is an option for the patients in the public health queue. We show that although patients with low waiting costs will choose public treatment, they may be better off with waiting time than without. The reason is that waiting time induces patients with high waiting costs to choose private treatment, thus reducing the cost of public health care that everyone pays for. Even if higher quality (i.e. zero waiting time) can be achieved at no cost, the self-selection induced redistribution may imply that it is socially optimal to provide health care publicly and at an inferior quality level. We give a detailed discussion of the circumstances in which it is optimal to have waiting time for public health treatment. Moreover, we study the interaction between this quality decision and the optimal tax/subsidy on private health care. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We use data from South Korea, where daughters and daughters-in-law are the prevalent source of caregivers for frail elderly parents and parents-in-law. A key insight of our instrumental variable approach is that having a parent-in-law with functional limitations increases the probability of providing informal care to that parent-in-law, but a parent-in-law's functional limitation does not directly affect the daughter-in-law's health. We compare results for the daughter-in-law and daughter samples to check the assumption of the excludability of the instruments for the daughter sample. Our results show that providing informal care has significant adverse effects along multiple dimensions of health for daughter-in-law and daughter caregivers in South Korea.

To evaluate the financial impact for primary care practices of integrating behavioral health services. Microsimulation model. We simulated patients and providers at federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), non-FQHCs in urban and rural high-poverty areas, and practices outside of high-poverty areas surveyed by the National Association of Community Health Centers, National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and National Health Interview Survey. A collaborative care model (CoCM), involving telephone-based follow-up from a behaviorist care manager, or a primary care behaviorist model (PCBM), involving an in-clinic behaviorist. Net revenue change per full-time physician. When behavioral health integration services were offered only to Medicare patients, net revenue was higher under CoCM (averaging $25,026 per MD in year 1 and $28,548/year in subsequent years) than PCBM (-$7052 in year 1 and -$3706/year in subsequent years). When behavioral health integration services were offered to all patients and were reimbursed by Medicare and private payers, only practices adopting the CoCM approach consistently gained net revenues. The outcomes of the model were sensitive to rates of patient referral acceptance, presentation, and therapy completion, but the CoCM approach remained consistently financially viable whereas PCBM would not be in the long-run across practice types. New Medicare payments may offer financial viability for primary care practices to integrate behavioral health services, but this viability depends on the approach toward care integration.', \"Public Significance Statement Frontline health care workers in the era of COVID-19 need access to emotional support services. This article provides a framework to guide health care institutions in developing emotional and mental health supports for their workforce during these unprecedented times. Frontline health care workers (HCWs) are experiencing a range of emotional responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including anxiety, traumatic stress, and burnout. As many as half of all HCWs will exhibit clinically significant distress. This distress may endure for years, and health care institutions must respond to these emotional needs. We propose the Matched Emotional Supports in Health Care (MESH) Framework to guide institutions in implementing a tiered, or stepped care model for deploying sustainable emotional support programs for HCWs for COVID-19 and beyond. Recognizing the variability in HCWs' response to stress, MESH outlines a continuum of services, including universal (e.g., self-help), selected (e.g., support from trained volunteers), and indicated (e.g., professional therapy, psychotropic medication management) interventions matched to individual need. We provide a targeted review of evidence-based resources available at each level of care and potential processes for determining when higher levels of care are needed. Finally, we delineate key implementation factors for institutions to consider in developing, implementing, and sustaining services for HCWs. Employing the MESH Framework may also facilitate health care institutions' ability to meet the fourth aim of the Quadruple Aims of Health Care to ensure a healthy workforce for this and future crises.\", 'The most important predictor of quality of health care across all racial and ethnic groups is access, especially insurance status and the ability to pay for health care. If we consider populations with equal access to health care, two groups emerge with differing qualities of health care: non-minority and minority populations. When studies control for the stage of disease at presentation, comorbidities, severity of illness, and other variables, substantial differences in health care based on race and ethnicity can still be found. Raising the consciousness of this issue is an important step toward recognizing and eliminating health care disparities.', 'Many children are treated for mental health disorders in primary care settings. The system of care (SOC) provides a framework for collaboration among pediatric mental health providers, but it is unclear if youth treated for mental health disorders in primary care receive such coordination. At the South Boston Community Health Center from September /2012 to August 2013 for 74 individuals 18 years, the odds of contact with SOC agencies (mental health, education, child protective services, juvenile justice and developmental disabilities) were compared for mental health treatment in primary versus specialty care. The odds of SOC contact within primary care were lower compared to specialty care (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.29-0.66), specifically for mental health (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.25-1.2), education (OR = 0.12, 95% CI = 0.050-0.28), and child protective services (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.22-1.9). As care coordination may improve health outcomes, increased support and education for care coordination specific to youth treated for mental health disorders in primary care settings may be warranted.', \"In 1999, the multidisciplinary Tavistock group prepared a generic statement of ethical principles to govern health care systems. This paper elaborates on these principles in two directions. First, it develops a set of quality standards, based on ethical principles, intended to regulate health care delivery and service management. Second, it focuses them on 'publicly oriented' (not necessarily governmental) as opposed to 'for profit' (not necessarily private) services. We propose ten principles or quality standards for these services, part of which relate to the individual patients, others to the community. They are political as well as technical, and can be used to inspire health policies, contracts issued by governments, and identification of partners by aid agencies. We analyse their application in key areas of health care by publicly oriented and for-profit health care organizations standards in developing countries, and conclude that the latter are unlikely to adopt the proposed standards. We further elaborate on the implications of the standards for publicly oriented services, focusing on care delivery and patient-centred care, family and community medicine, services management and disease control. Using these criteria for a renewed compact between authorities, health professionals and communities may help to motivate health professionals by bridging the gap between their professional and social-political identity.

This paper describes an underserved rural community in which health care initiatives increased access to comprehensive care. Over a three-year period, use of preventive services increased, whereas emergency room visits and hospitalizations at the community hospital decreased. Low birthweight, risk of congenital syphilis and childhood tuberculosis, and child mortality all decreased. Provision of comprehensive services was met with increased use of preventive health care and improved health outcomes in this rural community.', 'Background: Primary care providers (PCP) differ in their ability to address the needs and reduce use of costly services among complex Medicaid beneficiaries. Among PCPs, Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)-funded health centers (HCs) are shown to provide high-value care. Objective: We compared health care utilization of complex Medicaid managed care beneficiaries whose PCPs were HCs versus 3 other groups. Research Design: Cross-sectional study using propensity score matching comparing health care use by provider type, controlling for demographics, health status, and other covariates. Subjects: California Medicaid administrative data for complex adult managed care beneficiaries with at least 1 primary care visit in 2018. Measures: Primary and specialty care evaluation & management visits and services; emergency department (ED) visits; and hospitalizations. PCPs included HCs, clinics not funded by HRSA, solo, and group practice providers. Results: HRSA-funded HCs had lower predicted rates of specialty evaluation & management and other services than all others; lower predicted probability of any ED visits than clinics not funded by HRSA [54% (95% CI: 53%-55%) vs. 56% (95% CI: 55%-57%)] and group practice providers [51% (95% CI: 51%-52%) vs. 52% (95% CI: 52%-53%)]; and lower PP of any hospitalizations than solo [20% (95% CI: 19%-20%) vs. 23% (95% CI: 22%-24%)] and group practice providers [21% (95% CI: 20%-21%) vs. 24% (95% CI: 23%-24%)]. Conclusions: Differences in HC care delivery and practices were associated with lower use of specialty, ED, and hospitalization visits compared with other PCPs for complex Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. Understanding the underlying reasons for these utilization differences may promote better outcomes among these patients.', 'Objectives. To explore the effects of community-level factors an access to any behavioral health care and specialty behavioral health care. Data. Healthcare for Communities household survey data, merged to supplemental data from the 1990 Census Area Resource File, 1995 U.S. Census Bureau Small Area Estimates, and 1994 HMO enrollment data. Study Design. We use a random intercept model to estimate the influences of community-level factors on access to any outpatient care, any behavioral health care conditional on having received outpatient care, and any specialty behavioral health care conditional on having received behavioral health care. Data Collection. HCC data were collected in 1997 from about 10,000 households nationwide but clustered in 60 sites. Principal Findings. Individuals in areas with greater HMO presence have better overall access to care, which in turn affects access to behavioral health care; individuals in poorer communities have less access to specialty care compared to individuals in wealthier communities. Conclusions. Our findings of lower access to specialty care among those in poor communities raises concerns about the appropriateness and quality of the behavioral health care they are receiving. More generally, the findings suggest the importance of considering the current status and expected evolution of HMO penetration and the income level in a community when devising health care policy.', \"Basically, the workshop aims to raise and collect input to Part 2 (Health care process and workflow), currently under development, of the European standard EN 13940 Health informatics - System of concepts to support continuity of care, the general objective of which is to enable communication at the semantic level between information systems in health care in the perspective of continuity of care. Its scope encompasses identifying the various processes and process objects involved, taking into consideration resource management aspects, responsibilities of health care providers, and means for patients' participation. While the process description and concept system model is meant as a tool for the development of information systems, it may also be used for enterprise analysis and form the basis for organizational decisions and more widely organizational developments that are not inherently tied to the use of ICT.\", \"Background Many countries worldwide have experienced reductions in provision of formal long-term care services amidst rising need for care. Provision of unpaid care, meanwhile, has grown. This includes care provided by young people. Care responsibilities can affect a young people's health, education and employment. We aimed to investigate the impacts on the employment and health of young people aged 16 to 25 of providing care, and the associated individual and public expenditure costs. Methods We examined employment, earnings and health impacts for individuals, and a range of economic impacts for society, focusing on young people aged 16 to 25 providing unpaid care in England. We applied regression analysis to data from three waves of the UK Household Longitudinal Study (2013/2015, 2014/2016, and 2015/2017) to compare employment and health outcomes among carers and non-carers, and two-part Generalised Linear Models to estimate costs. To address potential selection bias, we then used propensity score matching methods to explore outcomes for a matched sub-sample of young adult carers who started providing care at baseline (2014/16). Results Young people aged 16 to 25 who provided care at baseline (2014/16) were less likely to be in employment, had lower earnings from paid employment, and had poorer mental and physical health at follow-up (2015/17) compared to young people of the same age who were not providing care at baseline.. There were substantial costs to the state of young adults providing care from lower tax revenue, welfare benefit payments, and health service use. In aggregate, these costs amounted to 1048 pound million annually in 2017. Conclusions High individual impacts and costs to the state of providing unpaid care, and the potential of such impacts to compound existing inequalities, have many implications for policy and practice in the health, social care, employment and welfare benefits sectors. In particular, the findings reinforce the case for reducing the need for young people to provide unpaid care, for example through better provision of formal care services, and to provide ongoing support for those young people whodoprovide care. As impacts are seen in a number of domains, support needs to be multidimensional.\", 'Most health care quality improvement efforts target measures of health care structures, processes, and/or outcomes. Structural measures examine relatively fixed aspects of health care delivery such as physical plant and human resources. Process measures, the focus of the largest proportion of quality improvement efforts, assess specific transactions in clinical-patient encounters, such as use of appropriate surgical antibiotic prophylaxis, which are expected to improve outcomes. Outcome measures, which comprise quality of life endpoints as well as morbidity and mortality, are of greatest interest to clinicians and patients, but entail the greatest complexity, as the majority of variance in outcomes is attributable to patient and environmental factors that may not be readily modifiable. Selecting among structure, process, and outcome measures for quality improvement efforts generally will be dictated by the specific clinical situation for which improvement is desired. One aspect of health care quality that has received a great deal of attention in recent years is the relationship between Surgical volume and health outcomes. Volume, an inherent characteristic of a health care facility or provider, is generally considered a structural measure of quality. Many studies have demonstrated a positive association between volume and outcomes, and policymakers in the private and public sectors have begun to consider volume in certification and reimbursement decisions. The volume-outcome association is not without controversy, however. Most studies in the field are limited by the nature of the administrative data on which they are based, and some Studies have found that variation in quality within volume quantiles exceeds differences between quantiles. Moreover, regionalization driven by a focus on volume may exert adverse effects on access to care. The movement for health care quality improvement faces substantial methodological, clinical, financial, and political challenges. Despite these challenges, it is a movement that is gaining momentum, and the emphasis on quality in health care delivery is likely only to increase in the future. It is crucial, therefore, that physicians assume increasing leadership roles in efforts to define, measure, report, and improve quality of care. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Research methods: We conducted 36 qualitative interviews with neonatal health care providers and hospital administrators and analysed data using a descriptive interpretive approach. Setting: 10 Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units in a single, integrated health care system in one Canadian province. Findings: Three major themes emerged: (1) providing family-centred care, (2) working amidst health care system challenges, and (3) recommending improvements to the health care system. The overarching theme was that the health care system was making 'too much noise' for health care providers and hospital administrators to provide family-centred care in waysthat would benefit infants and their families. Recommended improvements included: refining staffing models, enhancing professional development, providing tools to deliver consistent care, recognising parental capacity to be involved in care, strengthening continuity of care, supporting families to be with their infant, and designing family-friendly environments. Conclusion: When implementing family-centred care initiatives, health care providers and hospital administrators need to consider the complexity of providing care in Level II Neonatal Intensive Care Units, and recognise that health care system changes may be necessary to optimise implementation.

Published by Elsevier Ltd.\", 'Background:Medicaid expansion substantially increased health insurance coverage, but its effect on the delivery of preventative health care is unclear.Objective:The objective of this study was to assess the impact of Medicaid expansion on the receipt of 15 different measures of preventive care including cancer screening, cardiovascular risk reduction, diabetes care, and other primary care measures.Research Design:We performed serial cross-sectional analysis of Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data from 2012 to 2017. We used a quasi-experimental design with difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses to examine changes in preventative health care delivery over 3 time periods in Medicaid expansion compared with nonexpansion states.Subjects:We included low-income (<138% federal poverty level) nonelderly (age younger than 65y) adults residing in 46 US states.Measures:Our predictor was residing in a Medicaid expansion state (24 states) versus nonexpansion state (19 states). Our primary outcomes were preventative health care services, which we categorized as cancer screening (breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer); cardiovascular risk reduction (serum cholesterol screening in low-risk groups, serum cholesterol monitoring in high-risk groups, and aspirin use); diabetes care (serum cholesterol monitoring, hemoglobin A1c monitoring, foot examination, eye examination, and influenza vaccination, and pneumonia vaccination); and other primary care measures [influenza vaccination, alcohol use screening, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screening].Results:Survey responses from 500,495 low-income nonelderly adults from 2012 to 2017 were included in the analysis, representing 68.2 million US adults per year. Of the 15 outcomes evaluated, we did not detect statistically significant differences in cancer screening (3 outcomes), cholesterol screening or monitoring (2 outcomes), diabetes care (6 outcomes), or alcohol use screening (1 outcome) in expansion compared with nonexpansion states. Aspirin use (DiD 8.8%, P<0.001), influenza vaccination (DiD 1.4%, P=0.016), and HIV screening (DiD 1.9%, P=0.004) increased in expansion states compared with nonexpansion states.Conclusions:Medicaid expansion was associated with an increase in aspirin use, influenza vaccination, and HIV screening in expansion states. Despite improvements in access to care, including health insurance, having a primary care doctor, and routine visits, Medicaid expansion was not associated with improvements in cancer screening, cholesterol monitoring, diabetes care, or alcohol use screening. Our findings highlight implementation challenges in delivering high-quality primary care to low-income populations.', \"As interprofessional education (IPE) becomes more common in student training programs, reliable and valid scales are needed to measure students' perceptions of the experience. The Attitudes Toward Health Care Teams Scale (ATHCTS) was developed to measure students' attitudes toward IPE programs using 14 items loaded on two factors. In this paper, we used the ATHCTS scale to assess the effects of a three-semester long health care IPE program on three cohorts of nurse practitioner, occupational therapy, and physical therapy graduate students with three measurement points across two university sites (N = 367). Confirmatory factor analysis on the baseline data of the first cohort revealed unacceptable fit indices; in addition, not all items were applicable, some items had double or low factor loadings, and positively and negatively worded items loaded on separate factors, indicating potential answering bias, and both factors were highly correlated. We thus conducted further item analyses and propose a short version of the ATHCTS using six items with one reverse coded item, describing the quality of interprofessional care in a more parsimonious way. The factor structure of the six-item version was tested using confirmatory factor analysis on the baseline data of cohort 2 and 3. Results were compared to the 14-item version, and fit indices confirmed a better fit to the data than the old version. Using the shortened scale, student attitudes were compared over the course of the program and between both sites. Results showed that site 2 students' attitudes remained very positive over time, while site 1 students' attitudes declined significantly. We suggest this finding is related to the consistency of team membership at site 2 and discuss the implications for IPE program design.\", 'Health care delivery and payment systems are moving rapidly toward value-based care. To be successful in this new environment, providers must consistently deliver high-quality, evidence-based, and coordinated care to patients. This study assesses whether Project ECHO (R) (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) GEMH (geriatric mental health)a remote learning and mentoring program-is an effective strategy to address geriatric mental health challenges in rural and underserved communities. Thirty-three teleECHO clinic sessions connecting a team of specialists to 54 primary care and case management spoke sites (approximately 154 participants) were conducted in 10 New York counties from late 2014 to early 2016. The curriculum consisted of case presentations and didactic lessons on best practices related to geriatric mental health care. Twenty-six interviews with program participants were conducted to explore changes in geriatric mental health care knowledge and treatment practices. Health insurance claims data were analyzed to assess changes in health care utilization and costs before and after program implementation. Findings from interviews suggest that the program led to improvements in clinician geriatric mental health care knowledge and treatment practices. Claims data analysis suggests that emergency room costs decreased for patients with mental health diagnoses. Patients without a mental health diagnosis had more outpatient visits and higher prescription and outpatient costs. Telementoring programs such as Project ECHO GEMH may effectively build the capacity of frontline clinicians to deliver high-quality, evidence-based care to older adults with mental health conditions and may contribute to the transformation of health care delivery systems from volume to value.', \"Focusing on key principles and objectives of the health care reform in Austria, financing, planning, and decision-making within the new structures are discussed. The executive body of the Styrian State Health Fund, the Health Platforrn, has diverse tasks. The Platform is supported by two advisory bodies, one preparing decision-making, the other - unique within the German speaking countries - consulting on women's health issues. Health Care as a subject in the medical curriculum has been integrated in the course units of social medicine at the Medical University Graz. The subject focuses on social security issues and health care services. The extent of training, however, does not qualify medical students for management functions in health care.\", 'Objectives Although recent health care reform efforts have focused on minimizing high cost health care utilization, the relationship between acute care use and health care expenditures among certain vulnerable populations such as Medicaid-insured children remains poorly understood. We sought to evaluate the association between acute care utilization and health care expenditures and to identify characteristics associated with high spending. Methods We performed a retrospective cohort study of Medicaid-enrolled children 1-21 years old from 1/1/2016 to 12/31/2016. Children were categorized by acute care use (including emergency department and urgent care visits) as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more visits. Our main outcomes were annualized spending, total per-member-per-year spending, and acute care-related per-member-per-year spending. Results There were 5.1 million Medicaid-enrolled children that comprised the study cohort, accounting for US $32.6 billion in total spending. Children with 4 or more acute care visits were more likely to be younger than 2 years or older than 14 years, female, and have a chronic condition. Children with 4 or more acute care visits consisted of only 4% of the cohort but accounted for 15% (US $4.7 billion) of the total spending. Increasing acute care visits were associated with increasing total annualized spending in adjusted analyses (P < 0.001). This association was disproportionately observed in older age groups and children without chronic medical conditions. Conclusions Medicaid spending for children increases with increasing acute care use; this trend was disproportionately observed in older age groups and children without chronic medical conditions. Improved understanding of factors contributing to frequent acute care utilization and disproportionate spending is needed to potentially reduce unnecessary health care costs in these pediatric populations.', 'Background This paper aims to assess the barriers and solutions to the delivery of eye care in primary care settings and solutions to improve the use of comprehensive eye care among Indigenous Australians. Design, setting, participants Qualitative, mixed method study participants include Aboriginal community members, and health and eye care providers in urban, rural and remote settings. Main outcome measures Present evidence for health care providers to better understand and address some of the barriers that limit access to eye care in primary care settings. Results Patient perspectives on barriers to accessing eye care and reasons they choose to seek care or not are presented. Health system barriers identified by health and eye care providers are also presented. Additionally, key enablers for improving access to eye care through primary care services are identified. Conclusion Primary health care services have an important role in Indigenous eye health. There is a critical role for primary care in the coordination of the patient journey and cooperating with other services to improve access to comprehensive eye care. Through improved provision of primary eye care, monitoring of Indigenous eye health indicators and supporting patients to access eye care, it is possible to close the gap for vision.', \"Background To assess the quality of child health services in primary health care (PHC) facilities in Calabar, south-east Nigeria. Design Cross-sectional, descriptive design. Methods Key informant interviews, structured observation, self-administered questionnaire and focus group discussion. Setting Calabar, south-east Nigeria. Participants All 10 PHC facilities in Calabar, 252 PHC workers serving in the facilities, and 76 mothers whose children received care in the facilities. Outcome measures Adequacy of structure (equipment and personnel); process (diagnosis, training and knowledge, use of national case-management algorithm, and supervision), and output (clients' satisfaction). Main results PHC facilities were adequately equipped to the extent of providing immunization services and management of diarrhoea but not for other aspects of care expected of a PHC centre, including management of acute respiratory infections (ARI), a common problem in children in the region. Supply of essential drugs was inadequate in all centres and facilities for emergency care were lacking. Many of the health care workers (68.3%) had adequate training in immunization, and their knowledge scores on immunization issues (62%) was higher than in other aspect of PHC. Use of the national case management algorithm was low among PHC workers. Results of the focus group discussions with mothers showed that a few perceived quality of care to be poor. The main concerns were long waiting time, lack of essential drugs, and attitude of the health workers. Conclusions Inadequacy in the quality of child health services in PHC facilities is a product of failures in a range of quality measures - structural (lack of equipment and essential drugs), process failings (non-use of the national case management algorithm and lack of a protocol of systematic supervision of health workers). Efforts to improve the quality of child health services provided by PHC workers in the study setting and similar locales in less developed countries should focus not only on resource-intensive structural improvements, but also on cheap, cost-effective measures that address actual delivery of services (process), especially the proper use of national guidelines for case management, and meaningful supervision.\", 'Background: Care home residents in England have variable access to health care services. There is currently no coherent policy or consensus about the best arrangements to meet these needs. The purpose of this review was to explore the evidence for how different service delivery models for care home residents support and/or improve wellbeing and health-related outcomes in older people living and dying in care homes. Methods: We conceptualised models of health care provision to care homes as complex interventions. We used a realist review approach to develop a preliminary understanding of what supported good health care provision to care homes. We completed a scoping of the literature and interviewed National Health Service and Local Authority commissioners, providers of services to care homes, representatives from the Regulator, care home managers, residents and their families. We used these data to develop theoretical propositions to be tested in the literature to explain why an intervention may be effective in some situations and not others. We searched electronic databases and related grey literature. Finally the findings were reviewed with an external advisory group. Results: Strategies that support and sustain relational working between care home staff and visiting health care professionals explained the observed differences in how health care interventions were accepted and embedded into care home practice. Actions that encouraged visiting health care professionals and care home staff jointly to identify, plan and implement care home appropriate protocols for care, when supported by ongoing facilitation from visiting clinicians, were important. Contextual factors such as financial incentives or sanctions, agreed protocols, clinical expertise and structured approaches to assessment and care planning could support relational working to occur, but of themselves appeared insufficient to achieve change. Conclusion: How relational working is structured between health and care home staff is key to whether health service interventions achieve health related outcomes for residents and their respective organisations. The belief that either paying clinicians to do more in care homes and/or investing in training of care home staff is sufficient for better outcomes was not supported.', \"Background: Equity in health care across all social groups is a major goal in health care policy. Immigrants may experience more mental health problems than natives, but we do not know the extent to which they seek help from primary health care services. This study aimed to determine a) the rate immigrants use primary health care services for mental health problems compared with Norwegians and b) the association between length of stay, reason for immigration and service use among immigrants. Methods: National register data covering all residents in Norway and all consultations with primary health care services were used. We conducted logistic regression analyses to compare Norwegians' with Polish, Swedish, German, Pakistani and Iraqi immigrants' odds of having had a consultation for a mental health problem (P-consultation). Results: After accounting for background variables, all immigrants groups, except Iraqi men had lower odds of a P-consultation than their Norwegian counterparts. A shorter length of stay was associated with lower odds of a P-consultation. Conclusions: Service use varies by country of origin and patterns are different for men and women. There was some evidence of a possible 'healthy migrant worker' effect among the European groups. Together with previous research, our findings however, suggest that Iraqi women and Pakistanis in particular, may experience barriers in accessing care for mental health problems.\", 'Background: The sustainability of health and social care has led to an imperative to shift the balance of care to communities and support person-centered, integrated, preventive, comanaged, and sustainable care. The digital tool set can support this shift; however, it must extend beyond a clinical focus to include broader personal, social, and environmental needs, experiences, and outcomes. The existing digital health and care design and user requirements literature focuses mainly on specific digital products or design methods. There is little whole-system or whole-of-life consideration, which is crucial to enacting more significant transformations that span different groups and domains. Objective: This study aimed to present a set of recurring user requirements and themes for comanaged digital health and care services derived from the body of co-design projects within a digital health and care program. This study aimed to enable people and organizations looking to reorient their approach to health and care research and delivery from a system-led and condition-specific approach to a more person-centric, whole-of-life model. Methods: Participatory design formed the core methodological approach in underlying the design research, from which user requirements were derived. The process of surfacing requirements involved a selection framework for the identification of eligible projects and a structured review process to consolidate user requirements. Results: This paper presents a set of 14 common user requirements that resulted from a review of co-design projects. The findings demonstrate overlapping and reinforcing sets of needs from citizens and care professionals related to how data are comanaged to improve care and outcomes. This paper discusses the alignment, contrasts, and gaps with broader, comparable literature. It highlights consensus around requirements for personal health storytelling, sharing data on care experiences and how this can support personalized guidance, visualize trends to support decision-making, and generally improve dialog between a citizen and care professionals. These findings identify gaps around how groups and networks of people engage, posing difficult questions for people designing support services as some of the user requirements are not easily met by organizations operating in silos. Conclusions: This study proposes future recommendations for citizens as active, informed, and consenting partners using new forms of privacy-preserving digital infrastructure that puts the citizen in firm control. It is also recommended that these findings be used by people developing new digital services to ensure that they can start with knowledge of the broader user requirement context. This should inform domain-specific research and development questions and processes. Further work is needed to extend these common requirements to more explicitly consider the trust framework required when citizens comanage their data and care across a broad range of formal and informal actors. Consideration of how authority, delegation, and trust function between members of the public will be critical.', \"Background The digital transformation of healthcare enables new ways of working in cancer care directing attention on the digital skills of healthcare professionals. This systematic review aims to identify existing evidence about digital skills among health care professionals in cancer care to identify the needs for future education and research.Methods Database searches were conducted in PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane and ERIC to identify studies until March 2023. The inclusion criteria were digital skills of health care professionals in cancer care as described by themselves, other health care professionals, patients or significant others. The CASP tool was used for quality assessment of the studies. Data was analysed following inductive content analysis.Results The search produced 4563 records, of which 24 studies were included (12 qualitative, 10 quantitative, 1 mixed methods design and 1 strategy paper). Four main categories were identified describing HCPs' required skills, existing skills and development areas of digital skills in cancer care: Skills for information technology, Skills for ethical practice, Skills for creating a human-oriented relationship and Skills for digital education and support. In development areas, one more main category, Skills for implementing digital health, was identified.Conclusion The digital skills of health care professionals in cancer care are multifaceted and fundamental for quality cancer care. The skills need to be assessed to provide education based on actual learning needs. The review findings can be used for education and research in this field.\", 'Objective: We sought to examine the extent to which reported barriers to health care services differ between American Indians (AIs) and non-Hispanic Whites (Whites). Methods: A statewide stratified random sample of Minnesota health care program enrollees was surveyed. Responses from AI and White adult enrollees (n = 1281) and parents of child enrollees (n = 572) were analyzed using logistic regression models that account for the complex sample design. Barriers examined include: financial, access, and cultural barriers, confidence/trust in providers, and discrimination. Results: Both AIs and Whites report barriers to health care access. However, a greater proportion of AIs report barriers in most categories. Among adults, AIs are more likely to report racial discrimination, cultural misunderstandings, family/work responsibilities, and transportation difficulties, whereas Whites are more likely to report being unable to see their preferred doctor. A higher proportion of adult enrollees compared with parents of child enrollees report barriers in most categories; however, differences between parents of AIs and White children are more substantial. In addition to racial discrimination and cultural misunderstandings, parents of AI children are more likely than parents of White enrollees to report limited clinic hours, lack of Conclusions: Although individuals have enrolled in health care programs and have access to care, barriers to using these services remain. Significant differences between AIs and Whites involve issues of trust, respect, and discrimination. Providers must address barriers experienced by AIs to improve accessibility, acceptability, and quality of care for AI health care consumers.', \"Children with medical complexity have ongoing health needs that may require dependence on medical technologies. While hospital admissions are an important focus of care delivery for these children, a majority of the time they are cared for in their own homes. Parents' report feeling overwhelmed and stressed by the scope of their responsibilities, but they become sophisticated care providers and assume greater authority when providing their children's care at home. Communication, decision-making, and dealing with conflict with members of health care teams have been central concerns in parents' reports of their home health care experiences. The objective is to review literature on relational aspects of parent and home health care provider care practices for children with medical complexity receiving home health care services. A narrative review was conducted. A search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBM Reviews, PsychINFO, ERIC, and CINAHL databases for English language studies published since database inception was carried out. Eligible studies focused on relational aspects of parent and home health care provider care practices for children with medical complexity receiving home health care services. Nine empirical studies were selected for this review. Literature describes parents' and providers' experiences managing a child with medical complexity in the home and the effects for the family and the parent-health care provider relationship. Parents want to be actively involved in all aspects of care that affects their child and ultimately their family. Further investigation is needed to better understand relational aspects of parenthome health care provider care practices to support child/family health and well-being in the home setting.\", \"Background: Health care is provided under the conditions in which people live and under the rules and regulations of a prevailing health system. As a consequence, 'local' circumstances are an important determinant of the actual care that can be provided and its effects on the health of individuals and populations. This plays in particular, but not exclusively, a role in community - based primary health care. Although this is generally accepted, there is little insight in the impact of the setting and context inwhich health care is provided on the outcome of care. Aim: This paper argues the case to use this natural variation within and between countries as an opportunity to be used as a form of natural experiment in health research. Arguments: We argue that analysing and comparing outcomes across settings, that is comparative outcomes of interventions that have been performed under different health care conditions will improve the understanding of how the real - life setting in which health care is provided - including the health system, the socio - economic circumstances and prevailing cultural values - do determine outcome of care. Recommendations: To facilitate comparison of research findings across health systems and different socio - economic and cultural contexts, we recommend a more detailed reporting of the conditions and circumstances under which health research has been performed. A set of core variables is proposed for studies in primary health care.\", 'We summarize recent data on health and health care in the United States. Many millions suffer financial distress due to medical bills and forego needed care because of costs. Pay-for-performance programs have failed to achieve the results promised and in some cases have backfired. Health care firms expend huge amounts on marketing that provides no benefit to patients. Millions of health care workers, particularly women of color, are so poorly paid that they live in poverty, and gender-based pay inequities remain common in the health sector. Polls continue to show strong popular support for a single-payer reform, but politicians continue to resist it.', 'Objectives: This article outlines the budgetary setting within the UK health-care system. Methods: it is argued that while prospective budgets can give rise to efficient resource allocation outcomes, this relies on the budget being set at an appropriate level and the accompanying incentive structures being efficient. The organizational structures and the interrelationships are critical. The recent history of UK National Health Service reforms and expenditure is outlined. It is suggested that until recently, although the budget system has the potential to promote efficiency, the aggregate budget allocated to the NHS has probably been too low given public expectations, technology advances, and preferences for health care. Results: The aggregate budget is due to rise considerably over the next 5 years. While some incentive and regulatory provisions will move the budget toward an efficient allocation many microlevel incentive issues remain. Conclusion: Whether efficient patterns of health-care allocation emerge remains open to debate, however, because the existing incentive mechanisms are not optimal.', \"Objective To evaluate the impact of Medicaid managed care organizations (MCO) on health care access for adults with disabilities (AWDs). Data Sources Mandatory and voluntary enrollment data for AWDs in Medicaid MCOs in each county were merged with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and the Area Resource File for 1996-2004. Study Design I use logit regression and two evaluation perspectives to compare access and preventive care for AWDs in Medicaid MCOs with FFS. From the state's perspective, I compare AWDs in counties with mandatory, voluntary, and no MCOs. From the enrollee's perspective, I compare AWDs who must enroll in an MCO or FFS to those who may choose between them. Principal Findings Mandatory MCO enrollees are 24.9 percent more likely to wait > 30 minutes to see a provider, 32 percent more likely to report a problem accessing a specialist, and 10 percent less likely to receive a flu shot within the past year. These differences persist from the state evaluation perspective. Conclusions States should not expect a dramatic change in health care access when they implement Medicaid MCOs to deliver care to the adult disabled population. However, continued attention to specialty care access is warranted for mandatory MCO enrollees.\", \"Background: The effectiveness of a collaborative model of mental health treatment under conditions of routine care in a primary care setting has received limited evaluation. Potential effects include reduced symptoms and decreased healthcare utilization. Methods: The present study describes treatment outcome for 234 patients seen by a mental health professional in a primary care clinic using a collaborative model of care. Patients were seen for one session (n = 120), two sessions (n = 59), three sessions (n = 29), or four or more sessions (n = 26). Patients completed the Outcome Questionnaire-45 (OQ-45) at every session. Results: OQ-45 total scores for patients seen for more than one appointment showed statistically significant reductions in psychological distress from first to last session for all groups. Pre-treatment health care utilization was unrelated to level of psychological distress at the first session. A comparison of health care utilization for the six month period before and after the first session showed a small but statistically significant increase in total number of medical visits. Conclusions: The results support the effectiveness of a collaborative model of mental health care for reducing symptoms in patients seen in a primary care setting. Patient's overall healthcare utilization in the short term was largely unaffected.\", 'Rationale, aims, and objectives The health care delivery model in the United States does not work; it perpetuates unequal access to care, favours treatment over prevention, and contributes to persistent health disparities and lack of insurance. The vast majority of those who suffer from preventable diseases and health disparities, and who are at greatest risk of not having insurance, are low-income minorities (Native Americans, Hispanics, and African-Americans) who live in high risk and vulnerable communities. The historical lack of support in the United States for Universal Health Care (UHC) and Primary Health Care (PHC)-with their emphasis on health care for all, population health, and social determinants of health-requires community health scientists to develop innovative local solutions for addressing unmet community health needs. Methods We developed a model community health science approach for improving health in fragile communities, by combining community-oriented primary care (COPC), community-based participatory research (CBPR), asset-based community development, and service learning principles. During the past two decades, our team has collaborated with community residents, local leaders, and many different types of organizations, to address the health needs of vulnerable patients. The approach defines health as a social outcome, resulting from a combination of clinical science, collective responsibility, and informed social action. Results From 2000 to 2020, we established a federally funded research programme for testing interventions to improve health outcomes in vulnerable communities, by working in partnership with community organizations and other stakeholders. The partnership goals were reducing chronic disease risk and multimorbidity, by stimulating lifestyle changes, increasing healthy behaviours and health knowledge, improving care seeking and patient self-management, and addressing the social determinants of health and population health. Our programmes have also provided structured community health science training in high-risk communities for hundreds of doctors in training. Conclusion Our community health science approach demonstrates that the factors contributing to health can only be addressed by working directly with and in affected communities to co-develop health care solutions across the broad range of causal factors. As the United States begins to consider expanding health care options consistent with PHC and UHC principles, our community health science experience provides useful lessons in how to engage communities to address the deficits of the current system. Perhaps the greatest assets US health care systems have for better addressing population health and the social determinants of health are the important health-related initiatives already underway in most local communities. Building partnerships based on local resources and ongoing social determinants of health initiatives is the key for medicine to meaningfully engage communities for improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities. This has been the greatest lesson we have learned the past two decades, has provided the foundation for our community health science approach, and accounts for whatever success we have achieved.', \"The health care system constitutes the organisational framework in which health care delivery takes place. The system and its reforms, therefore, have to reckon with the typical aspects of care delivery and medical practice. Medicine is not the application of medical scientific knowledge but can better be understood as a 'professional practice'. `Practice' is understood as a complex and coherent form of socially established cooperative human activity directed at the realisation of the destination inherent to that practice. The destination of medical practice is to provide adequate medical carl to a person in need because of health problems. This means that medical practice is ethically qualified. The destination of medical practice can be realised by competent performance of the practice, which means that the rules that constitute, i.e. define and limit, that practice are observed. These rules are predominantly of a 'knowing how' kind (tacit knowledge). Health care systems and health care reforms should respect this character of medical practice. The way in which health care expenses are financed, in other words, the health insurance system, forms part of the health care system and can only be evaluated in the latter's context. In order to define positive and negative aspects of health care systems and insurance systems we describe three ideal- type health care systems, the guild-free-choice system, the centrally planned health service and managed competition. Existing systems can be understood as one of these systems, often with elements of the other(s). The combination of this systems analysis and our normative view of medical practice provides us with normative guidelines for the organisation of health care and for the function of health insurance as part of it.\", \"The aim of this paper was to implement and evaluate health promoting palliative care projects through partnerships formed within local communities in the Hume Region, Victoria, Australia. Health promoting palliative care is a public health approach to palliative care developed by Kellehear (1999). This article reports on a project in which the Hume Regional Palliative Care Service in Victoria, Australia sought to implement the approach through partnerships formed with a range of community groups and service agencies in their region. Funding was provided over a two-year period by the 'Caring Communities Program' of the Australian Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing. It was hoped that the project overall would increase community capacity to participate in the care of members of the community living with dying and loss. The project developed implementation strategies and health promotion project guidelines, as outlined below. During the two-year period the palliative care service entered in a number Of new partnerships with community groups and other health services. At first much of the initiative in forming these partnerships came from the palliative care service, but as the project progressed the initiative came increasingly from community partners.\", 'Health care transitions (HCT) from pediatric to adult health care remain a challenge for children and youth with special health care needs (CYSHCN), their families and their clinicians. While the HCT literature has expanded, gaps remain in how to improve health outcomes during transitions. HCTs broadly encompass three key domain areas: transition planning, transfer to adult health care clinicians or an adult model of care, and integration into an adult care/model of care. The CYSHCNet national research agenda development process, described in a previous article, prioritized several key research areas to address deficiencies in the HCT process. The highest priority questions identified were What are the best models to accomplish youth-adult transition planning? How might this translate to other transitions (eg, to new clinicians, new settings, new schools, etc.)? and How do gaps in insurance and community supports during early adulthood effect CYSHCN health outcomes, and how can they be reduced?. Based upon these priorities, we describe the current state of transition research and recommendations for future investigation. Recommendations: The authors recommend 3 primary areas of investigation: 1) Understanding the optimal development and implementation of HCT service models in partnership with youth and families to improve transition readiness and transfer 2) Defining the process and outcome measures that capture adequacy of transition-related activities and 3) Evaluating fiscal policies that incentivize the processes of transition readiness development, transfer to adult health care services, and continuity of care within an adult health care setting. This article explores approaches within each research domain.', \"BackgroundIn January 2010, the choice reform was instituted in Swedish primary health care establishing free entry for private primary health care providers and enabling patients to choose freely among primary health care centers. The motivation behind the reform was to improve access to primary care and responsiveness to patient expectations. Reform effects on health care utilization have previously been investigated by using subgroup analyses assuming a pattern of homogeneous subgroups of the population. By using a different methodological approach, the aim of this study was to, from an equity perspective, investigate long term trends of primary health care utilization following the choice reform.MethodA closed cohort was created based on register data from Region Skane, the third most populated region in Sweden, describing individuals' health care utilization between 2007-2017. Using a novel approach, utilization data, measured as primary health care visits, was matched with socioeconomic and geographic determinants, and analyzed using logistic regression models.ResultsA total of 659,298 individuals were included in the cohort. Sex differences in utilization were recorded to decrease in the older age group and to increase in the younger age group. Multivariable logistic regression showed increasing utilization in older men to be associated with higher socioeconomic position, while in women it was associated with lower socioeconomic position. Furthermore, groups of becoming high utilizers were all associated with lower socioeconomic position and with residence in urban areas.ConclusionThe impact of demographic, socioeconomic and geographic determinants on primary health care utilization varies in magnitude and direction between groups of the population. As a result, the increase in utilization as observed in the general population following the choice reform is unevenly distributed between different population groups.\", \"In cancer care, communication and coordination across the cancer continuum is paramount for delivering effective, high-quality, patient-centered care. However, achieving optimally coordinated cancer care is inherently challenging, especially in the case of Veterans Administration (VA) care for women's reproductive health cancers. Given the relatively small number of women Veterans requiring care for reproductive malignancies, VA often must rely on community providers to deliver this care, necessitating coordination across two or more health care systems. Recently, VA has invested heavily in improving care for women Veterans through several initiatives and efforts. This article reviews VA's successes, challenges, and future opportunities in research and innovation in the context of care coordination across the cancer continuum (i.e., prevention and screening, diagnosis and treatment, survivorship care, palliative and supportive care) for women Veterans with reproductive health malignancies. We describe how coordination of VA care for reproductive health malignancies currently reflects a mix of successes that demonstrate use of strong evidenced-based practices and challenges, with solutions yet to be fully developed and implemented. We conclude that there are a multitude of opportunities for future research, interventions, and potential avenues for implementing innovative approaches to coordinate VA reproductive cancer care across the cancer continuum.\", 'Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death and important driver of health care costs. Recent German health care reforms have promoted integrated care contracts allowing statutory health insurance providers more room to organize health care provision. One,provider offers KardioPro, an integrated primary care-based CHD prevention program. As insurance providers should be aware of the financial consequences when developing optional programs, this study aims to analyze the costs associated with KardioPro participation. 13,264 KardioPro participants were compared with a propensity score-matched control group. Post-enrollment health care costs were calculated based on routine data over a follow-up period of up to 4 years. For those people who incurred costs, KardioPro participation was significantly associated with increased physician costs (by 33%), reduced hospital costs (by 19%), and reduced pharmaceutical costs (by 16%). Overall costs were increased by 4%, but this was not significant. Total excess costs per observation year were (sic)131 per person (95% confidence interval: [(sic)-36.5; (sic)296]). Overall, KardioPro likely affected treatment as the program increased costs of physician services and reduced costs of hospital services. Further effects of substituting potential inpatient care with increased outpatient care might become fully apparent only over a longer time horizon. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The two concepts developed quite differently however. The concept of self care did not attain the same level of legitimacy and stability as health promotion, which has evolved from an alternative approach to the dominance of traditional disease prevention into a rapidly developing health field. The emergence of the concept of self care and the reasons for its relative lack of acceptance are discussed. It is concluded that the concept of self care is logically allied with the field of health promotion and serves an important function in optimizing health related behavior.', 'China has gone through a comprehensive health care insurance reform since 2003 and achieved universal health insurance coverage in 2011. The new health care insurance system provides China with a huge opportunity for the development of health care and medical research when its rich medical resources are fully unfolded. In this study, we review the Chinese health care system and its implication for medical research, especially within clinical epidemiology. First, we briefly review the population register system, the distribution of the urban and rural population in China, and the development of the Chinese health care system after 1949. In the following sections, we describe the current Chinese health care delivery system and the current health insurance system. We then focus on the construction of the Chinese health information system as well as several existing registers and research projects on health data. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges of the health care system in regard to clinical epidemiology research. China now has three main insurance schemes. The Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) covers urban employees and retired employees. The Urban Residence Basic Medical Insurance (URBMI) covers urban residents, including children, students, elderly people without previous employment, and unemployed people. The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) covers rural residents. The Chinese Government has made efforts to build up health information data, including electronic medical records. The establishment of universal health care insurance with linkage to medical records will provide potentially huge research opportunities in the future. However, constructing a complete register system at a nationwide level is challenging. In the future, China will demand increased capacity of researchers and data managers, in particular within clinical epidemiology, to explore the rich resources.', \"Aim To describe parental perceptions of general health, oral health and received dental health care in Swedish children with Down syndrome (DS). Methods Online questionnaire, quantitative data analysis (Chi-square test). Results Parents of 101 children with DS (52 boys, 49 girls, mean age: 9.6 years) participated. Seventy percent rated their child's general health and 74% their child's oral health as good or very good. Parents, who rated their child's oral health as poor (8%), also reported that dental procedures were difficult. Children received dental care at general (55%) and specialist clinics (53%). Ninety-four percent of parents of children receiving specialist dental health care were satisfied compared to 70% of parents with children in general clinics. The parents most valued characteristics of dental professionals were patience (63%) and their ability to engage the child (68%). Parents wanted multidisciplinary collaboration. Conclusion Most parents rated their child's general and oral health as good or very good. Children with poor oral health were also reported to have difficulties coping with dental procedures. Parents wanted dental care to be tailored to meet their child's unique needs. They wanted dental professionals to have knowledge about children with a need for special care. Lastly, they requested multidisciplinary collaboration.\", \"Progress to address health care equity requires health care providers' commitment, but their engagement may depend on their perceptions of the factors contributing to inequity. To understand providers' perceptions of causes of racial health care disparities, a short survey was delivered to health care providers who work at 3 Veterans Health Administration sites, followed by qualitative interviews (N = 53). Survey data indicated that providers attributed the causes of disparities to social and economic conditions more than to patients' or providers' behaviors. Qualitative analysis revealed differences in the meaning that participants ascribed to these causal factors. Participants who believed providers contribute to disparities discussed race and racism more readily, identified the mechanisms through which disparities emerge, and contextualized patient-level factors more than those who believed providers contributed less to disparities. Differences in provider understanding of the underlying causal factors suggest a multidimensional approach to engage providers in health equity efforts.\", \"Over the last decade, health literacy has become a vibrant area of research. Our objective was to evaluate health literacy and its association with socio-demographic variables, self-perception of health and the presence of chronic conditions in primary health-care patients. A cross-sectional study among 120 patients was conducted in two primary health-care centers. The test of functional health literacy in adults, a 50-item reading comprehension and 17-item numerical ability test (score, 0-100) were administered. Chi-square test and logistic regression analyses were applied. Inadequate and marginal health literacy existed in 43 participants (41.0%), and adequate health literacy was present in 62 participants (59.0%). Functional health literacy was significantly different by location, gender, age, marital status, employment, education, material status, self-perception of health and presence of chronic conditions. Based on the multivariate analysis, health literacy was significantly associated with the participant's age (odds ratio [OR], 4.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.41-9.80; P = 0.000), level of education (OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.73-11.57; P = 0.002) and chronic conditions (OR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.16-3.11; P = 0.010). These results provide evidence that limitations in functional health literacy are widespread among primary health-care patients and encourage efforts for further monitoring. Low health literacy may impair a patient's understanding of health messages and limit their ability to attend to their medical problems.\", 'Health care reform has become a global phenomenon. Countries are experiencing similar problems with their health care systems and are reaching for similar solutions. Management is seen as crucial in many countries as the principal means of securing supply-side reforms. Many of these centre on establishing a new relationship between professionals, notably the medical profession, and the state. The aim has been to exercise greater influence over how professionals practice and use resources. The application of new public management principles based on industrial sector practices and concepts of management has created tensions within professional groups who feel themselves, and their craft, to be under attack. But the new managerialism has to be seen within a context of rapid social and economic change. It is not possible to predict what the impact of such change is likely to be on health services in the future or on those who provide them. The paper offers an overview of health care reforms and assesses how it is shaping, or re-shaping, the roles and tasks of health care personnel. One conclusion is the mismatch between the management style favoured by policy-makers and reformers and the necessary flexibility required in skill mix and organization of work. High-trust relations lie at the heart of professional forms of organisation whereas the new managerialism appears to be based on the expectation of low-trust relations. The paper concludes with a brief look at the implications of all these developments for training and education and finds that there is still a long way to go before there is any real prospect of providing and equipping health care personnel with the requisite skills to enable them to meet the complex challenges that are a common characteristic of health care systems.

The program was designed with the belief that dedicated team member time, senior leadership engagement, deliberate project/team selection, and robust, tailored project support would enable rapid and transformative health care redesign. Three teams were supported in the initial 1-year funding cycle; all 3 teams successfully designed, implemented, and tested new care models for different serious illness populations. Results demonstrated improved satisfaction, decreased length of stay, and a positive return on investment. Critical evaluation of current structures and processes will help identify refined strategies to support diverse teams that will challenge the norms of health care delivery and explore novel partnerships, approaches, and settings for care delivery. This article helps advance the conversation on how to think strategically and critically about current and future health care innovation efforts.', \"Background People with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD) have combined severe intellectual and physical disability and need extensive health care support. They cannot communicate by spoken language and need around the clock support. The health care for people with PIMD is typically provided by a number of different health care services in collaboration with residential care staff and their managers. The quality of health care for people with PIMD are important due to their limited ability to communicate their needs. The aim of this study was to explore residential care staff and manager's experiences and views of health care services for adults with PIMD. Methods Thirteen semi-structured interviews with residential care staff (n = 7) and managers (n = 6) were conducted and analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results The informants expressed a variety of experiences, under the theme was Quality of health care is enhanced through residential care staff. The theme was comprised of four subthemes: (1) Individually tailored support promotes quality, (2) Accessibility requires adaptation and prioritization by healthcare providers, (3) Disability competence promotes quality and safety and (4) Complex collaboration conditions between the person with PIMD, residential care staff and disability health care. Conclusions The residential care staff create quality of care in their role as representatives for adults with PIMD. The care situation is complex and requires adequate competence in the disability, the individual's needs and adaptations to ensure quality of health care. It is also important to build collaboration with other services that are involved in the care of people with PIMD.\", \"As the health care system moves in a new direction, toward managed care, the critical role of public health in society's efforts to mitigate illness and the realization of health become more apparent. Indeed, the public health problems of this era will not yield to simple solutions. They require a multitude of resources, both human and material, and a myriad of services derived from these resources. Public health's role is to serve as the government's presence in assessing health status, developing policy, evaluating the effectiveness of policy implementation, and assuring access to and quality of comprehensive health services. Increasingly, public health must coordinate a wide array of systems in both the private and public sectors to fulfill its purpose.\", \"Background: While research on individual health literacy is steadily increasing, less attention has been paid to the context of care that may help to increase the patient's ability to navigate health care or to compensate for their limited health literacy. In 2012, Brach et al. introduced the concept of health literate health care organizations (HLHOs) to describe the organizational context of care. This paper presents our effort in developing and validating an HLHO instrument. Method: Ten items were developed to represent the ten attributes of HLHO (HLHO-10) based on a literature review, an expert workshop, a focus group discussion, and qualitative interviews. The instrument was applied in a key informant survey in 51 German hospitals as part of a larger study on patient information and training needs (PIAT-study). Item properties were analyzed and a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to test the instrument's unidimensionality. To investigate the instrument's predictive validity, a multilevel analysis was performed that used the HLHO-10 score to predict the adequacy of information provided to 1,224 newly-diagnosed breast cancer patients treated at the sample hospitals. Results: Cronbach's a of the resulting scale was 0.89. CFA verified the one-factor structure after allowing for the correlation for four pairs of error terms. In the multilevel model, HLHO-10 significantly predicted the adequacy of information as perceived by patients. Conclusion: The instrument has satisfactory reliability and validity. It provides a useful tool to assess the degree to which health care organizations help patients to navigate, understand, and use information and services. Further validation should include participant observation in health care organizations and a sample that is not limited to breast cancer care.\", \"Health care organizations increasingly recognize the impact of social needs on health outcomes. As organizations develop and scale efforts to address social needs, little is known about the optimal role for clinicians in providing social care. In this study, the authors aimed to understand how health care organizations involve clinicians in formal social care efforts. In 2019, the authors conducted 33 semi-structured interviews with administrators at 29 health care organizations. Interviews focused on the development and implementation of formal social care programs within the health care organization and the role of clinicians within those programs. A few administrators described formal roles for primary care clinicians in organizational efforts to deliver social care. Administrators frequently described programs that were deliberately structured to shield clinicians (eg, clinicians were not expected to review social risk screening results or be involved in addressing social needs). The authors identified 4 ways that administrators felt clinicians could meaningfully engage in social care programs: (1) discuss social risks to strengthen relationships with patients; (2) adjust clinical care follow-up plans based on social risks; (3) modify prescriptions based on social risks; and (4) refer patients to other care team members who can directly assist with social risks. Administrators were hesitant to increase primary care clinicians' responsibilities by tasking them with social care activities. Defining appropriate and scalable roles for clinicians along with adequate support from other care team members may increase the effectiveness of social care programs.\", 'Primary health care in Australia has undergone 2 decades of change. Starting with a vision for a national health strategy with general practice at its core, Australia established local meso-level primary health care organizations-Divisions of General Practice-moving from focus on individual practitioners to a professional collective local voice. The article identifies how these meso-level organizations have helped the Australian primary health care system evolve by supporting the roll-out of initiatives including national practice accreditation, a focus on quality improvement, expansion of multidisciplinary teams into general practice, regional integration, information technology adoption, and improved access to care. Nevertheless, there are still challenges to ensuring equitable access and the supply and distribution of a primary care workforce, addressing the increasing rates of chronic disease and obesity, and overcoming the fragmentation of funding and accountability in the Australian system.

Despite major advances in the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer, health care ministries face multitiered challenges to create and support health care programs that can improve breast cancer outcomes. In addition to the financial and organizational problems inherent in any health care system, breast health programs are hindered by a lack of recognition of cancer as a public health priority, trained health care personnel shortages and migration, public and health care provider educational deficits, and social barriers that impede patient entry into early detection and cancer treatment programs. No perfect health care system exists, even in the wealthiest countries. Based on inevitable economic and practical constraints, all health care systems are compelled to make trade-offs among four factors: access to care, scope of service, quality of care, and cost containment. Given these trade-offs, guidelines can define stratified approaches by which economically realistic incremental improvements can be sequentially implemented within the context of resource constraints to improve breast health care. Disease-specific vertical programs warrant horizontal integration with existing health care systems in limited-resource countries. The Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI) Health Care Systems and Public Policy Panel defined a stratified framework outlining recommended breast health care interventions for each of four incremental levels of resources (basic, limited, enhanced, and maximal). Reallocation of existing resources and integration of a breast health care program with existing programs and infrastructure can potentially improve outcomes in a cost-sensitive manner. This adaptable framework can be used as a tool by policymakers for program planning and research design to make best use of available resources to improve breast health care in a given limited resource setting.', 'This paper presents a detailed description of health care resource utilisation and costs of a pilot interdisciplinary health care model of palliative home care in Ontario, Canada. The descriptive evaluation entailed examining the use of services and costs of the pilot program: patient demographics, length of stay broken down by disposition (discharged, alive, death), access to services/resources, use of family physician and specialist services, and drug use. There were 434 patients included in the pilot program. Total costs were approximately CAN$2.4 million, and the cost per person amounted to approximately CAN$5586.33 with average length of stay equal to over 2 months (64.22 days). One may assume that length of stay would be influenced by the amount of service and support available. Future research might investigate whether in-home palliative home care is the most cost effective and suitable care setting for those patients requiring home care services for expected periods of time. Palliative Medicine (2009); 23: 448-459', \"Background. The authors examined the relationship between receipt of routine medical care and receipt of dental care among children with special health care needs (CSHCN) who resided in the American Dental Association's Fifth Trustee District, which includes Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi. Methods. The authors conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the 2001 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, a module of that year's State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey (sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Maternal and-Child Health Bureau of the Health Resources and Service Administration, Rockville, Md., and conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta). The authors used bivariate and logistic regression analyses to explore the relationships (n = 2,092) between predisposing, enabling and need factors and receipt of dental care. Results. The parents of an estimated 76 percent of CSHCN in the district reported that their child had a need-for dental care in the previous 12 months. Of these, 13.1 percent did not receive care. Failure to obtain needed dental care was associated with failure to obtain routine medical care, as was having a lower income. Conclusions. Failure to obtain routine medical care may be a risk factor for failure to obtain dental care. Any income below 400 percent of the federal poverty guidelines appears to be a barrier to receiving dental care for CSHCN. Practice Implications: Providers of routine medical care may play an important role in linking CSHCN to dental care. Investigators need to examine other barriers to dental care for CSHCN. Strategies to optimize access to dental care for CSHCN at all income levels are needed.\", 'The relationship between health care expenditure and health outcomes has been the subject of recent academic inquiry in order to inform cost-effectiveness thresholds for health technology assessment agencies. Previous studies in public health systems have relied upon data aggregated at the national or regional level; however, there remains debate about whether the supply side effect of changes to expenditure are identifiable using data at this level of aggregation. We use detailed patient data derived from electronic neonatal records across England along with routinely available cost data to estimate the effect of changes to patient expenditure on clinical health outcomes in a well-defined patient population. A panel of 32 neonatal intensive care units for the period 2009-2013 was constructed. Accounting for the potential endogeneity of expenditure a 100 pound increase in the cost per intensive care cot day (sample average cost: 1,127) pound is estimated to reduce the risk of mortality of 0.38 percentage points (sample average mortality: 11.0%) in neonatal intensive care. This translates into a cost per life saved in neonatal intensive care of approximately 420,000 pound.', \"Background Trans and gender-diverse people face multiple barriers within health care. Primary care practitioners are key to providing health care to trans and gender-diverse people but they often lack training in, and understanding of, trans identities and healthcare options. Few studies have examined health professionals' understanding of the barriers that exist in health care for trans and gender-diverse people. Aim To map out barriers to providing good-quality health care to trans and gender-diverse people, and explore ways to address them. Design and setting A qualitative interview study involving 20 health professionals working with young trans and gender-diverse people. Method Participants were recruited through purposive and snowball sampling. Data were generated using semi-structured qualitative interviews. A thematic analysis involved coding and categorising data using NVivo (version 12) software and further conceptual analysis in which developing themes were identified. Results Four barrier domains to good-quality care for trans and gender-diverse people were identified: structural (related to lack of guidelines, long waiting times, and shortage of specialist centres); educational (based on lack of training on trans health); cultural and social (reflecting negative attitudes towards trans people); and technical (related to information systems and technology). Conclusion There is an urgent need to address the barriers trans and gender-diverse people face in health care. Structural-level solutions include health policy, professional education, and standards; at the practice level, GPs can act as potential drivers of change in addressing the cultural and technical barriers to better meet the needs of their trans and gender-diverse patients.\", 'Objective: To estimate the average incremental health care expenditures associated with habitual long and short duration of sleep as compared with healthy/average sleep duration. Data Source: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data (2012; N=6476) linked to the 2010-2011 National Health Interview Survey. Study Design: Annual differences in health care expenditures are estimated for habitual long and short duration sleepers as compared with average duration sleepers using 2-part logit generalized linear regression models. Principal Findings: Habitual short duration sleepers reported an additional $1400 in total unadjusted health care expenditures compared to people with average sleep duration (P<0.01). After adjusting for demographics, socioeconomic factors, and health behavior factors, this difference remained significant with an additional $1278 in total health care expenditures over average duration sleepers (P<0.05). Long duration sleepers reported even higher, $2994 additional health care expenditures over average duration sleepers. This difference in health care expenditures remained significantly high ($1500,P<0.01) in the adjusted model. Expenditure differences are more pronounced for inpatient hospitalization, office expenses, prescription expenses, and home health care expenditures. Conclusions: Habitual short and long sleep duration is associated with higher health care expenditures, which is consistent with the association between unhealthy sleep duration and poorer health outcomes.', 'The objective of this concept analysis was to formulate an operational definition, so that those seeking, providing, and legislating health care policy would share a common interpretation of the concept. A concept analysis following the strategy suggested by Walker and Avant was used to identify antecedents, attributes, and empirical referents of access to health care. Furthermore, model, borderline, contrary, and invented cases were described. A theoretical definition was derived, which will lead to a better understanding of the concept and bring the concept closer to measurability and readiness for an operational definition. Access to health care has been addressed in political campaigns, studied by numerous legislative committees, and purported to be in an emergency state of disrepair. However, a measurable definition of access to health care continues to elude providers and legislators of health care; in as much, the meaning of the concept varies with the user.', 'This article explores legislative provisions in relation to patient privacy in the context of integrated health and social care and the development of multidisciplinary health care teams that include practitioners from private sector and government agencies in the health, education, child protection, family welfare, disability, aged-care, housing, local government and criminal justice sectors. The definition of a multidisciplinary health care team and the extent to which health information can be shared within the team is examined. Australian Commonwealth and State legislation provides for the sharing within a health care team of health information where that is for the primary purpose it was collected, and for a secondary purpose where that is directly related to the primary purpose, or might be reasonably expected by the patient for the provision of their care. For this purpose consent is not required.', 'The authors of ???Integration or Fragmentation of Health Care? Examining Policies and Politics in a Belgian Case Study??? present a fresh perspective on the inertia of integrated care (IC) implementation. They conclude that the decisive power in Belgium is fragmented and undermines efforts towards IC. As researchers in integrated heart failure care and active primary health care professionals, we comment on the three policy initiatives evaluated by Martens et al from a bottom-up perspective. A Learning Health Care Network (LHCN) was established Sept 2019 to overcome fragmentation, the lack of evaluation and capacity loss each time a pilot project ends. This commentary wishes to illustrate that a LHCN can be a powerful meso-level mechanism to engage in alignment work and to overcome macro-level barriers that are often difficult to change and not supportive of IC.', 'Advance care planning and symptom management (supportive cancer care) improves patient experiences and reduces acute care use (hospitalizations and emergency department visits). Strong evidence supports team-based approaches to deliver supportive cancer care. However no studies, to our knowledge, have evaluated the use of lay or community health workers to deliver supportive cancer care as compared to usual cancer care. The Health Care Coach Support intervention was developed to improve cancer care. The intervention assigns a lay or community health worker health coach to all patients newly diagnosed with advanced stages of cancer or patients with recurrent or progressive disease. The intervention aims to educate and activate patients in advance care planning discussions and symptom management with their clinicians. Patients are randomized in a 1:1 allocation to either the 12-month health coach intervention combined with usual oncology care or usual oncology care alone. The primary outcome is to evaluate whether the intervention reduces acute care use measured at 6-months follow-up more than usual care. Secondary outcomes include the effect on acute care, palliative care, and hospice at 12-months follow-up and one month prior to death for patients who die. Additional secondary outcomes include changes in patient satisfaction with decision and patient satisfaction with care from baseline (time of enrollment) to 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months post-enrollment. The Health Coach Support study addresses an important gap in supportive cancer care by testing whether a team-based approach using non-professional personnel can ensure delivery of these services. Findings can assist in our understanding of how to improve care for patients with cancer. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration #NCT03154190', \"Objectives: Our two study objectives were: (1) to understand the relationship between the perception of a previous negative health-care experience and race/ethnicity, and how socio-demographic, access-to-health-care, and self-reported health variables modified this relationship; and (2) to assess how many behaviors participants reported changing as a result of experiencing a perceived negative health-care experience, which behaviors they changed, and if there were differences in patterns of change across racial/ethnic groups. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a convenience sample of 600 African-American, Mexican-Hispanic, and white adults in socioeconomically diverse neighborhoods in Chicago, IL. We used multivariable logistic regression to analyze the relationship between a perceived negative health-care experience in the last 5 years and race/ethnicity. We summed and then calculated the percentage of people who changed each of the 10 behaviors and evaluated whether or not there were differences in behavior change across racial/ethnic groups. Principal findings: More than 32% of participants reported a perceived negative health-care experience in the past 5 years. Participants who had a bachelor's degree or above (OR: 2.95, 95% CI: 1.01-8.63), avoided needed care due to cost (OR: 1.84, 95% CI: 1.11-3.06), or who reported fair/poor health (OR: 3.58, 95% CI: 1.66-7.80) had significantly increased odds of reporting a negative health-care experience. Of these people, 88% reported 'sometimes/always' changing at least one health-seeking behavior. There were no racial/ethnic differences in reporting negative experiences or in patterns of behavior change. Conclusions: Race/ethnicity was not related to reporting a perceived negative health-care experience or reported patterns of behavior change in response to that experience. However, those who avoided care due to cost were more highly educated, or who indicated poorer health status reported having a negative experience more often. Our findings suggest that the perception of a previous negative experience may influence subsequent health-care-seeking behaviors.\", \"BACKGROUND: The influence of prior patterns of health care utilization on future health care utilization has had minimal investigation in populations with musculoskeletal disorders. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between presurgical health care utilization and postsurgical health care utilization in a population of patients undergoing hip surgery in the US Military Health System. METHODS: In this observational cohort study, person-level data were collected for patients undergoing hip arthroscopy in the Military Health System from 2003 to 2015, capturing all encounters 12 months before and 24 months after surgery for every individual. Cluster analysis was used to categorize individuals with high and low health care utilization, based on preoperative health care visits. Unadjusted and adjusted Poisson and generalized linear models were generated. Health care utilization outcomes were targeted, including costs, visits, and medication use. RESULTS: There were 1850 individuals in the final cohort (mean age, 32.18 years; 55.4% male). The high health care utilization group averaged 57.69 +/- 25.87 visits, compared to 20.43 +/- 8.36 visits in the low utilization group. There were significant differences between groups for total health care visits (58.17; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.39, 58.58), total health care costs ($11 539.71; 95% CI: $10 557.26, $12 595.04), hip-related visits (12.77; 95% CI: 12.59, 12.96), hip-related costs ($3325.07; 95% CI: $2886.43, $3804.51), days' supply of pain medications (752.67; 95% CI: 751.24, 754.11), opioid prescriptions (48.83; 95% CI: 48.47, 49.21), and cost of pain medications ($1074.80; 95% CI: $1011.91, $1137.68). CONCLUSION: Presurgical patterns of health care utilization were associated with postsurgical patterns of health care utilization, indicating that those patients who used more care before surgery also used more care after surgery. Clinicians should consider prior patterns of health care utilization, including utilization unrelated to the index condition, when determining care plans and prognosis.\", \"The aim of this study was to examine the procedures of primary dental health care performed by oral health teams (OHTs) adhering to the second cycle of the 'National Programme for Improving Access and Quality of Primary Care' (PMAQ-AB) in Brazil. A cross-sectional descriptive analysis was performed, across 23 dental procedures comprising preventive, restorative/prosthetic, surgical, endodontic and oral cancer monitoring. Descriptive analysis shows that most of the oral health teams carry out basic dental procedures. However, most of the time, they do not keep adequate records of suspected cases of oral cancer, diagnosis tests or follow-ups, and do not perform dental prosthetic procedures. Data also showed disparities in the average number of procedures performed in each Brazilian geographical region in 2013-2014, ranging from 13.9 in the northern to 16.5 in the southern and south-eastern regions, reinforcing the great social disparities between them. Brazilian regions with the highest volume of dental need deliver the lowest number of dental procedures. The need to tackle inequalities and further shape the supply of appropriate primary health care (PHC) is evident.\", 'Background Having a sufficient and well-functioning health workforce is crucial for reducing the burden of disease and premature death. Health workforce development, focusing on availability, recruitment, retention, and education, is inseparable from acceptability, motivation, burnout, role and responsibility, and performance. Each aspect of workforce development may face several challenges, requiring specific strategies. However, there was little evidence on barriers and strategies towards comprehensive health workforce development. Therefore, this review explored barriers and strategies for health workforce development at the primary health care level around the world.Methods A scoping review of reviews was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews. The article search was performed in Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE. We used EndNote x9 for managing the collected articles, screening processes, and citation purpose. The scoping review included any kind of review articles on the application of health workforce development concepts, such as availability, recruitment, retention, role and responsibility, education and training, motivation, and burnout, with primary health care and published in English anywhere in the world. Based on the concepts above, barriers and strategies for health workforce development were identified. The findings were synthesized qualitatively based on the building blocks of the health system framework. The analysis involved specific activities such as familiarization, construction of the thematic framework, indexing, charting, and interpretation. The results were presented in texts, tables, and figures.Results The search strategies yielded 7,276 papers were found. Of which, 69 were included in the scoping review. The most frequently cited barriers were financial challenges and issues related to health care delivery, such as workloads. Barriers affecting healthcare providers directly, including lack of training and ineffective teamwork, were also prominent. Other health system and governance barriers include lack of support, unclear responsibility, and inequity. Another notable barrier was the shortage of health care technology, which pertains to both health care supplies and information technology. The most common cited effective strategies were ongoing support and supervision, engaging with communities, establishing appropriate primary care settings, financial incentives, fostering teamwork, and promoting autonomous health care practice.Conclusions Effective leadership/governance, a robust health financing system, integration of health information and technology, such as mobile health and ensuring a consistent supply of adequate resources are also vital components of primary health care workforce development. The findings highlight the importance of continuous professional development, which includes training new cadres, implementing effective recruitment and retention mechanisms, optimising the skill mix, and promoting workplace wellness. These elements are essential in fostering a well-trained and resilient primary health care workforce.', 'The accountable care organization (ACO) provides an opportunity to strategically design a comprehensive health system in which oral health works within primary care. A dental hygienist/therapist within the ACO represents value-based health care in action. Background Inspired by health care reform efforts in Minnesota, a vision of an accountable care organization that integrates oral health into primary health care was developed. Dental hygienists and dental therapists can help accelerate the integration of oral health into primary care, particularly in light of the compelling evidence confirming the cost-effectiveness of care delivered by an allied workforce. Methods A dental insurance Chief Operating Officer and a dental hygiene educator used their unique perspectives and experience to describe the potential of an interdisciplinary team-based approach to individual and population health, including oral health, via an accountable care community. Conclusions The principles of the patient-centered medical home and the vision for accountable care communities present a paradigm shift from a curative system of care to a prevention-based system that encompasses the behavioral, social, nutritional, economic, and environmental factors that impact health and well-being. Oral health measures embedded in the spectrum of general health care have the potential to ensure a truly comprehensive healthcare system.', \"Background: Older persons are often poorly served by existing models of community-based primary health care (CBPHC). We sought input from clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers on recommendations for system improvements. Methods: Focus group interviews were held with clients, informal caregivers, and health care providers in mid-sized urban and rural communities in Ontario. Data were analyzed using a combination of directed and emergent coding. Results were shared with participants during a series of feedback sessions. Results: An extensive list of barriers, facilitators, and recommended health system improvements was generated. Barriers included poor system integration and limited access to services. Identified facilitators were person and family-focused care, self-management resources, and successful collaborative practice. Recommended system improvements included expanding and integrating care teams, supports for system navigation, and development of standardized information systems and care pathways. Conclusions: Older adults still experience frustrating obstacles when trying to access CBPHC. Identified barriers and facilitators of improved system integration aligned well with current literature and Wagner's Chronic Care Model. Additional work is needed to implement the recommended improvements and to discern their impact on patient and system outcomes.\", 'This paper derives a necessary and sufficient condition under which increased health care productivity must lead to decreased (increased) demand for health care as long as the demand for health care is inelastic (elastic). It is shown that this condition identifies a class of health production functions, which may provide useful guidance to empirical studies that depend wholly or partly on the correct specification of a health production function. As an illustration, it is demonstrated that this class of production functions may be useful for empirical studies that test the hypothesis that schooling, increasing the efficiency of health production, leads to a larger health output from a given set of health inputs. The paper also offers broader classes of production functions that would enable one to test this relationship between the demand elasticity and the effect of health care productivity on health care demand. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.', 'The Primary Health Care strategy is based on organization of interdisciplinary teams and comprehensive approach to health, disease and health care processes. To strengthen information systems so that they represent primary health care complexities, participatory meetings were held with primary care practitioners from the public health care system of Buenos Aires City. Terms for the record tool and its components were chosen using consensus methodologies. This process involved 300 practitioners from 49 centers, and submission of 21 proposals. It was decided to change the term Electronic Medical Record with Comprehensive Health Record. It was also agreed that, apart from Reason for Consultation, the field Problem Situation would be added, that Care Service would be replaced with Care Act, and that a new module Health Team Management and Education Activities would be included to document practitioners team activities.', 'The term psychologically informed health care  refers to the comprehensive integration of psychological principles into health care. Psychologically informed health care has the potential to lead to a transformation of care, resulting in truly transdisciplinary care. To facilitate its future development, we discuss key characteristics of this approach. These include the direct mode (psychologists assessing and treating patients themselves) and indirect mode (psychologists working through other health care providers) of integrating psychological principles into healthcare; the range of health domains targeted using this approach; transdisciplinary care, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries; and the positioning of care. We describe a framework for transdisciplinary care, which we refer to as the Framework for Catalytic Collaboration. This framework comprises six dimensions: setting, disciplines, patients/clients, mode of psychological care, primary components of care, and primary targets of care. We also provide four brief illustrations of psychologically informed health care. Finally, we discuss future directions, including the need for professional recognition of the indirect mode, financing of the indirect mode, cross-disciplinary training and trans-disciplinary research.', \"Background: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) primary care providers (PCPs) often see few women, making it challenging to maintain proficiency in women's health (WH). Therefore, VHA in 2010 established Designated WH Providers, who would maintain proficiency in comprehensive WH care and be preferentially assigned women patients. Objective: To evaluate early implementation of this national policy. Methods: At each VHA health care system (N = 140), the Women Veterans Program Manager completed a Fiscal Year 2012 workforce capacity assessment (response rate, 100%), representing the first time the national Designated WH Provider workforce had been identified. Assessment data were linked to administrative data. Results: Of all VHA PCPs, 23% were Designated WH Providers; 100% of health care systems and 83% of community clinics had at least 1 Designated WH Provider. On average, women veterans comprised 19% (SD = 27%) of the patients Designated WH Providers saw in primary care, versus 5% (SD = 7%) for Other PCPs (P < 0.001). For women veterans using primary care (N = 313,033), new patients were less likely to see a Designated WH Provider than established women veteran patients (52% vs. 64%; P < 0.001). Conclusions: VHA has achieved its goal of a Designated WH Provider in every health care system, and is approaching its goal of a Designated WH Provider at every hospital/community clinic. Designated WH Providers see more women than do Other PCPs. However, as the volume of women patients remains low for many providers, attention to alternative approaches to maintaining proficiency may prove necessary, and barriers to assigning new women patients to Designated WH Providers merit attention.\", 'Population health in the United States continues to lag behind other wealthy nations. Primary care has the promise of enhancing population health; however, the implementation of a population health approach within primary care deserves further consideration. Clinicians and staff from a national sample of 10 innovative primary care practices participated in a working conference to reflect upon population health approaches in primary care. A series of small- and large-group discussions were recorded, transcribed, and coded through an immersion/crystallization approach. Two prominent themes emerged: (1) Transitioning to a population health focus generally develops through stages, with early implementation focusing on risk stratification and later, more advanced stages focusing on community health; and (2) Several inherent barriers confront implementation of a population health approach, including tensions with patient-centered care, and limitations of health information technology. A broader conceptualization of population health in terms of community health could more effectively allow partnerships among primary care, large health care systems, public health organizations, patients, and other partners in the community.', \"Introduction: Research on partnerships between parents and health care professionals (HCPs) to improve adolescent health is limited. In this study, we have developed an empirically derived framework to guide research in this particular area. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study using focus groups and in-depth semi-structured interviews. A total of 85 participants (51 HCPs, 17 mothers of patients of ages 12-18 years, and 17 adolescents) were recruited from three free-standing adolescent health clinics and five school-based health centers across North Carolina. We independently explored the perceptions of HCPs and mothers regarding the roles of parents, HCPs, and parent-HCP partnerships in preventing and addressing adolescent health problems. We then elicited feedback of adolescents on mother and HCP perceptions. We identified common and informative themes during content analysis using ATLAS. ti, and triangulated perspectives of HCPs, mothers, and adolescents to develop a framework for building parent-HCP partnerships to improve adolescent health. Results: A general framework emerged that conceptualizes both direct and indirect strategies for building parent-HCP partnerships. Direct strategies involve strengthening relationships and/or communication between parents and HCPs in both practice and community settings. Indirect strategies involve opportunities for HCPs to influence parent-adolescent relationships and/or communication within the context of adolescent visits. For example, HCPs can discuss the importance of parental involvement and monitoring with adolescents, encourage and facilitate parent-adolescent communication, and deliver tailored parental guidance while also respecting adolescents' desires for confidential health care when appropriate. Conclusions: Interventions that directly strengthen parent-HCP relationships and/or communication, and those that indirectly support parent-HCP partnerships within the context of adolescent health care, should be designed targeting health outcomes.

Infrastructural deficiencies of health services are reported in literature and research. A number of instruments exist for the assessment of infrastructure. However, no easy-to-use instruments to assess health facility infrastructure in developing countries are available. Present tools are not applicable for a rapid assessment by health facility staff. Therefore, health information systems lack data on facility infrastructure. Methods: A rapid assessment tool for the infrastructure of primary health care facilities was developed by the authors and pilot-tested in Tanzania. The tool measures the quality of all infrastructural components comprehensively and with high standardization. Ratings use a 2-1-0 scheme which is frequently used in Tanzanian health care services. Infrastructural indicators and indices are obtained from the assessment and serve for reporting and tracing of interventions. The tool was pilot-tested in Tanga Region (Tanzania). Results: The pilot test covered seven primary care facilities in the range between dispensary and district hospital. The assessment encompassed the facilities as entities as well as 42 facility buildings and 80 pieces of technical medical equipment. A full assessment of facility infrastructure was undertaken by health care professionals while the rapid assessment was performed by facility staff. Serious infrastructural deficiencies were revealed. The rapid assessment tool proved a reliable instrument of routine data collection by health facility staff. Conclusions: The authors recommend integrating the rapid assessment tool in the health information systems of developing countries. Health authorities in a decentralized health system are thus enabled to detect infrastructural deficiencies and trace the effects of interventions. The tool can lay the data foundation for district facility infrastructure management.', 'Background: Cambodia is a country where the resources for treating mental health disorders are far from sufficient. One strategy to narrow the treatment gap is to integrate mental health into primary health care (PHC). Understanding the knowledge and attitudes towards mental health integration that health-care workers have is important for assessing the challenges and opportunities when planning a potential integration project. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess these basic conditions in Lvea Em District, Cambodia. Design: A structured self-reporting questionnaire regarding attitudes and knowledge about mental health and its integration into PHC was collected from 75 health-care workers in Lvea Em District, Cambodia in October 2015. Firstly, descriptive analyses were carried out, and secondly, linear regression analyses to assess the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic variables were conducted. Results: There was clear support towards integrating mental health services into PHC among these participants as 81.3% were interested in personally delivering mental health care at their units. Respondents who reported having received some kind of mental health-care training tended to have a more positive attitude towards mentally ill people (p = 0.005) and those who thought there was a high need for mental health care had a more favourable attitude towards the integration of mental health services (p = 0.007). Conclusions: The most important finding from this survey was the willingness and the acceptance of the need for integration of mental health care. This enhances the feasibility of integrating mental health services at the PHC level. Improving the competence of mental health care in these settings will likely help to reduce the treatment gap for mental, neurological and substance use disorders in Cambodia.', \"Artificial intelligence (AI) in health care is the future that is already here. Despite its potential as a transformational force for primary care, most primary care providers (PCPs) do not know what it is, how it will impact them and their patients, and what its key limitations and ethical pitfalls are. This article is a beginner's guide to health care AI, written for the frontline PCP. Primary care-as the dominant force at the base of the health care pyramid, with its unrivaled interconnectedness to every part of the health system and its deep relationship with patients and communities-is the most uniquely suited specialty to lead the health care AI revolution. PCPs can advance health care AI by partnering with technologists to ensure that AI use cases are relevant and human-centered, applying quality improvement methods to health care AI implementations, and advocating for inclusive and ethical AI that combats, rather than worsens, health inequities.\", 'Background Child care workers play an important role in caring for children attending child care yet there is little research regarding their health. Methods The study consisted of focus groups with child care workers and a survey, conducted as part of a larger study known as the Healthy Child Care Study, which focused on children. The study investigated carers working in formal child care [long day care (LDC) and family day care (FDC)]. Results Questionnaires to caregivers in centres showed that 86% had taken sick leave in the previous year and 75% of staff had taken leave for infectious illness. Carers in FDC reported that 24% had taken sick leave in the previous year and 12% of carers had taken leave for infectious illness. Of responding caregivers from centres, 22% were cigarette smokers while in FDC homes, 8% of carers smoked. In focus groups, carers reported that their major areas of health concern were stress, infectious illness and physical trauma such as lifting injuries. Conclusions Child care workers in LDC took more sick leave than those in FDC but this is not necessarily due to more illness. Child care workers are a diverse and important group that require further research.', \"PURPOSE It has been suggested that the best way to improve chronic illness care is through a redesign of primary care emphasizing comprehensive, coordinated care as espoused by the Chronic Care Model (CCM). This study examined the relationship between primary care orientation and the implementation of the CCM in physician organizations. METHODS The relationship between measures of primary care orientation and the CCM was examined in a sample of 957 physician organizations from the National Study of Physician Organizations, a cross-sectional telephone survey of all US medical groups and independent practice associations with 20 or more physicians (response rate, 70%). RESULTS After adjusting for potential confounders, 6 of 8 measures of primary care orientation were associated with physician organizations' adoption of 11 elements of CCM chronic care management. These 6 measures were severity of chronic illness treated in primary care, health promotion activity, health education activity, any accepted financial risk for hospitalization, required reporting, and presence of an electronic standardized problem list. Presence of an electronic medical record and the 5-year primary care physician turnover rate were not associated. CONCLUSIONS Organizations that have adopted 6 core attributes of primary care, representing comprehensive health service delivery and a commitment to overall patient health, appear to use more chronic care management practices. Policy makers and other stakeholders may wish to focus on creating an improved primary care home in their quest to close the quality chasm in chronic illness care.\", 'Purpose: Transgender veterans are overrepresented in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) compared with in the general population. Utilization of multiple different health care systems, or health care mobility, can affect care coordination and potentially affect outcomes, either positively or negatively. This study examines whether transgender veterans are more or less health care mobile than nontransgender veterans and compares the patterns of geographic mobility in these groups. Methods: Using an established cohort (n = 5,414,109), we identified 2890 transgender veterans from VHA electronic health records from 2000 to 2012. We compared transgender and nontransgender veterans on sociodemographic, clinical, and health care system-level measures and conducted conditional logistic regression models of mobility. Results: Transgender veterans were more likely to be younger, White, homeless, have depressive disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and hepatitis C. Transgender veterans were more likely to have been health care mobile (9.9%) than nontransgender veterans (5.2%) (unadjusted odds ratio = 2.02, 95% confidence interval = 1.73-2.36). In a multivariable model, transgender status, being separated/divorced, receiving care in less-complex facilities, and diagnoses of depression, PTSD, or hepatitis C were associated with more mobility, whereas older age was associated with less mobility. For the top three health care systems utilized, a larger proportion of transgender veterans visited a second health care system in a different state (56.2%) than nontransgender veterans (37.5%). Conclusions: Transgender veterans were more likely to be health care mobile and more likely to travel out of state for health care services. They were also more likely to have complex chronic health conditions that require multidisciplinary care.', \"Background and Objectives: Few who experience sexual assault seek health care immediately. Yet many become heavy users of health care resources in the years postassault because sexual violence has been linked with both acute and chronic health consequences. Our objective was to investigate servicewomen's medical and mental health (MH) care utilization after sexual assault in-military (SAIM) and identify reasons for not seeking care. Methods: In a retrospective cross-sectional Midwestern community sample of OEF/OIF Active Component and Reserve/National Guard servicewomen, currently serving and veterans, computer-assisted telephone interviews were conducted with 207 servicewomen who experienced SAIM. Results: A quarter (25%) received post-SAIM MH care and 16% medical care. Utilization of medical care tended to be sooner (within the first month) and MH care later (6mo to 1+y). Most sought care on a military base, a third from civilian providers, and 10% sought MH from Veterans Health Administration. Servicewomen were more likely to have utilized medical care if they had experienced a completed SAIM and made a Department of Defense SAIM report and MH care if they were white, experienced on-duty SAIM, and made a Department of Defense SAIM report. The most common reason for not seeking medical care was due to belief that care was not needed. Reasons for not utilizing medical or MH care included embarrassment, confidentiality concerns, and fear of adverse career consequences. Conclusions: Few servicewomen utilized post-SAIM care, thus assault-specific health consequences were likely unaddressed. Given the severe and chronic consequences of sexual assault, our findings emphasize need for military, Veterans Health Administration, and civilian providers to query SAIM history to provide timely and optimal care.\", \"Current trends in health care delivery and management such as predictive and personalized health care incorporating information and communication technologies, home-based care, health prevention and promotion through patients' empowerment, care coordination, community health networks and governance represent exciting possibilities to dramatically improve health care. However, as a whole, current health care trends involve a fragmented and scattered array of practices and uncoordinated pilot projects. The present paper describes an innovative and integrated model incorporating and assembling best practices and projects of new innovations into an overarching health care system that can effectively address the multidimensional health care challenges related to aging patient especially with chronic health issues. The main goal of the proposed model is to address the emerging health care challenges of an aging population and stimulate improved cost-efficiency, effectiveness, and patients' well-being. The proposed home-based and community-centered Integrated Healthcare Management System may facilitate reaching the persons in their natural context, improving early detection, and preventing illnesses. The system allows simplifying the health care institutional structures through interorganizational coordination, increasing inclusiveness and extensiveness of health care delivery. As a consequence of such coordination and integration, future merging efforts of current health care approaches may provide feasible solutions that result in improved cost-efficiency of health care services and simultaneously increase the quality of life, in particular, by switching the center of gravity of health delivery to a close relationship of individuals in their communities, making best use of their personal and social resources, especially effective in health delivery for aging persons with complex chronic illnesses.\", \"Most studies have concluded that good prenatal care plays an essential role in improving birth outcomes, and numerous reports have documented barriers to adequate prenatal care. The relationship between health care insurance eligibility and enrollment procedures and adequacy of prenatal care, however, has not been suitably investigated. This study used data from a statewide representative sample of recently delivered women in South Carolina to assess (1) patterns of health care insurance source and (2) the independent effects of Medicaid enrollment and application procedures on receipt of prenatal care. Health insurance during pregnancy varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Black women's experiences with Medicaid enrollment and application procedures were associated with less than adequate prenatal care. Programmatic efforts and policies should emphasize further improvement in the systems of health care access and delivery to disadvantaged women.\", \"Background/Objectives Medicare-certified home health agencies are required to offer family caregiver training, but little is known regarding the potential impact of this training on outcomes during home health care. We estimate the proportion of family caregivers assisting Medicare home health patients who have unmet training needs and examine whether these unmet training needs are associated with older adults' risk of acute care utilization during home health care. Design Observational, nationally representative cohort study. Setting Linked National Health and Aging Trends Study, Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS), Medicare Provider of Services file, and Medicare claims data from 2011 to 2016. Participants Thousand two hundred seventeen (weighted n = 5,870,905) community-living Medicare beneficiaries who received home health care between 2011 and 2016. Measurements Family caregivers' unmet training needs measured from OASIS and Medicare claims; home health patients' acute care utilization (including emergency department use and hospitalization) measured from OASIS. Results Rates of unmet need for training varied by activity, from 8.2% of family caregivers assisting with household chores to 16.0% assisting with self-care tasks. After controlling for older adult and home health provider characteristics, older adults whose family caregivers had an unmet need for training with any caregiving activity were twice as likely to incur acute care utilization during their home health episode (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-3.38). This relationship held across specific caregiving activities including household chores (aOR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.13-3.46), medication management (aOR: 2.50; 95% CI: 1.46-4.26), patient supervision (aOR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.36-6.24), and self-care tasks (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.62-6.00). Conclusions and Relevance Unmet training needs among family caregivers are associated with greater likelihood of acute care utilization among Medicare beneficiaries receiving home health care. Identifying and addressing family caregivers' training needs may reduce older adults' risk of acute care utilization during home health care.\", \"Objective: Explore the perceptions of patients and health care professionals about patients' ideas, concerns, expectations (ICE), and satisfaction in consultations with general practitioners (GPs), district nurses (DNs) and physiotherapists (PTs). Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire study of participants in planned consultations. Setting: Five primary health care centers and two rehabilitation centers in Stockholm, Sweden. Subjects: Pairs of patients and GPs (n = 156), patients and DNs (n = 73), and patients and PTs (n = 69). Main outcome measures: Multiple-choice questions about patients' ICE and satisfaction. Results: Approximately 75% of patients and GPs reported that patients' thoughts and explanations about their symptoms emerged during the consultation. For patient-DN pairs, the figure was 60%, and for patient-PT pairs, 80%. A majority of patients reported not having concerns and anxiety about the investigation/treatment, whereas health care professionals thought patients were more concerned. One-third of patients consulting GPs and PTs expected to receive a reason/explanation for their symptoms. Figures were lower for the DNs. About 70% of patients were satisfied with the consultation. Conclusions: Most patients expressed their ideas, a minority had concerns, and a minority expected an explanation of their illness. Patients and health care professionals rated patient satisfaction high, but health care professionals tended to believe patients were less satisfied than patients reported they were.\", \"This article compares the organization of the Swedish health care system with that in three other countries, the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, focussing on three main areas: (1) the provision and financing (public or private) of health insurance, including the question of the quality of the insurance protection offered; (2) the organization of the production of health services, and the economic incentives on the system's decision-makers (doctors, hospital managers, politicians, etc.). Possible answers are suggested to the question why one country (the U.K.) is able to provide health care to its population at an average cost considerably below that of the others: Differences in the quality of the insurance protection and health services; in the incentives on the system managers to exercise cost control; and in the incentives on service providers such as physicians, to consider cost-effectiveness when making treatment decisions. An attempt is made to suggest lessons for health care reform in Sweden and elsewhere.\", 'Utilization-based approaches have predominated the measurement of socioeconomic-related inequity in health care. This approach, however, can be misleading when preferences over health and health care are correlated with socioeconomic status, especially when the underlying focus is on equity of access. We examine the potential usefulness of an alternative approach to assessing inequity of access using a direct measure of possible barriers to access-self-reported unmet need (SUN)-which is documented to vary with socioeconomic status and is commonly asked in health surveys. Specifically, as part of an assessment of its external validity, we use Canadian longitudinal health data to test whether self-reported unmet need in one period is associated with a subsequent deterioration in health status in a future period, and find that it is. This suggests that SUN does reflect in part reduced access to needed health care, and therefore may have a role in assessing health system equity as a complement to utilization-based approaches.', 'Population health care is health information and clinical services provided to individuals of a defined population. From a population health care perspective, quality of care involves the health status of the entire population, and thus issues of access, cost of care, and efficiency matter. In this paper, we describe the definitions of quality health care and the framework for measuring quality, with emphasis on the performance of organizations involved in the delivery and assurance of population health care. We describe quality measurement sets and systems, criteria for the choice of measures, data sources, and how quality measurements are used to improve health care and outcomes from a population health care perspective.', 'We show that when health care providers have market power and engage in Cournot competition, a competitive upstream health insurance market results in over-insurance and over-priced health care. Even though consumers and firms anticipate the price interactions between these two markets - the price set in one market affects the demand expressed in the other - Pareto improvements are possible. The results suggest a beneficial role for Government intervention, either in the insurance or the health care market. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We estimate difference-in-difference-in-differences models that exploit variation in treatment intensity from 2 sources: (1) local area prereform uninsured rates from 2013 and (2) state participation in the Medicaid expansion. Including the third postreform year leads to 2 important insights. First, gains in health insurance coverage and access to care from the policy continued to increase in the third year. Second, an improvement in the probability of reporting excellent health emerged in the third year, with the effect being largely driven by the non-Medicaid expansions components of the policy.', 'Objectives: Dental care for elderly nursing home residents is traditionally provided at fixed dental clinics, but domiciliary dental care is an emerging alternative. Longer life expectancy accompanied with increased morbidity, and hospitalisation or dependence on the care of others will contribute to a risk for rapid deterioration of oral health so alternative methods for delivering oral health care to vulnerable individuals for whom access to fixed dental clinics is an obstacle should be considered. The aim was to analyse health economic consequences of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents in Sweden, compared to dentistry at a fixed clinic. Methods: A review of relevant literature was undertaken complemented by interviews with nursing home staff, officials at county councils, and academic experts in geriatric dentistry. Domiciliary dental care and fixed clinic care were compared in cost analyses and cost-effectiveness analyses. Results: The mean societal cost of domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents was lower than dental care at a fixed clinic, and it was also considered cost-effective. Lower cost of dental care at a fixed dental clinic was only achieved in a scenario where dental care could not be completed in a domiciliary setting. Conclusions: Domiciliary dental care for elderly nursing home residents has a lower societal cost and is cost-effective compared to dental care at fixed clinics. To meet current and predicted need for oral health care in the ageing population alternative methods to deliver dental care should be available.', 'Health disparities, also known as health inequities, are systematic and potentially remediable differences in one or more aspects of health across population groups defined socially, economically, demographically, or geographically (88). This topic has been the subject of research stretching back at least decades. Reports and studies have delved into how inequities develop in different societies and, with particular regard to health services, in access to and financing of health systems. In this review, we consider empirical studies from the United States and elsewhere, and we focus on how one aspect of health systems, clinical care, contributes to maintaining systematic differences in health across population groups characterized by social disadvantage. We consider inequities in clinical care and the policies that influence them. We develop a framework for considering the structural and behavioral components of clinical care and review the existing literature for evidence that is likely to be generalizable across health systems over time. Starting with the assumption that health services, as one aspect of social services, ought to enhance equity in health care, we conclude with a discussion of threats to that role and what might be done about them.', 'Background:This paper provides statewide estimates on health care access and utilization patterns and physical and behavioral health by citizenship and documentation status among Latinos in California.Methods:This study used data from the 2011-2015 California Health Interview Survey to examine health care access and utilization and physical and behavioral health among a representative sample of all nonelderly Latino and US-born non-Latino white adults (N=51,386). Multivariable regressions estimated the associations between the dependent measures and citizenship/documentation status among Latinos (US-born, naturalized citizen, green card holder, and undocumented).Results:Adjusted results from multivariable analyses observed worse access and utilization patterns among immigrant Latinos compared with US-born Latinos, with undocumented immigrants using significantly less health care. Undocumented Latinos had lower odds of self-reporting excellent/very good health status compared with US-born Latinos, despite them having lower odds of having several physical and behavioral health outcomes (overweight/obesity, physician-diagnosed hypertension, asthma, self-reported psychological distress, and need for behavioral health services). Among those reporting a need for behavioral health services, access was also worse for undocumented Latinos when compared with US-born Latinos.Conclusions:Patterns of poor health care access and utilization and better physical and behavioral health are observed across the continuum of documentation status, with undocumented immigrants having the worst access and utilization patterns and less disease. Despite fewer reported diagnoses and better mental health, undocumented Latinos reported poorer health status than their US-born counterparts.', 'Objective To evaluate differences in access to behavioral health services for Medicaid enrollees covered by a Medicaid entity that integrated the financing of behavioral and physical health care (carve-in group) versus a Medicaid entity that separated this financing (carve-out group). Data Sources/Study Setting Medicaid claims data from two Medicaid entities in the Portland, Oregon tri-county area in 2016. Study Design In this cross-sectional study, we compared differences across enrollees in the carve-in versus carve-out group, using a machine learning approach to incorporate a large set of covariates and minimize potential selection bias. Our primary outcomes included behavioral health visits for a variety of different provider types. Secondary outcomes included inpatient, emergency department, and primary care visits. Data Collection We used Medicaid claims, including adults with at least 9 months of enrollment. Principal Findings The study population included 45,786 adults with mental health conditions. Relative to the carve-out group, individuals in the carve-in group were more likely to access outpatient behavioral health (2.39 percentage points, p < 0.0001, with a baseline rate of approximately 73%). The carve-in group was also more likely to access primary care physicians, psychologists, and social workers and less likely to access psychiatrists and behavioral health specialists. Access to outpatient behavioral health visits was more likely in the carve-in arrangement among individuals with mild or moderate mental health conditions (compared to individuals with severe mental illness) and among black enrollees (compared to white enrollees). Conclusions Financial integration of physical and behavioral health in Medicaid managed care was associated with greater access to behavioral health services, particularly for individuals with mild or moderate mental health conditions and for black enrollees. Recent changes to incentivize financial integration should be monitored to assess differential impacts by illness severity, race and ethnicity, provider types, and other factors.', \"This study concerns measuring the quality of health services in long-term residential mental health care. The issue of measuring the quality of health services has been limited to services at residential health care centers (ZOL). The aim of the study is to propose measures associated with the provision of services in long-term residential mental health care. Currently, there are no tools for measuring the psychiatric services provided. The consequence of that is that the monitoring-supervisory-control mechanism that should ensure the required level of quality of services provided in this area of psychiatric care is inefficient. The aim of the deliberations made in this study is presenting an appropriate set of measures to assess the performance of a residential health care provider, taking into account the specificity of long-term mental health care (ZOL). The application of the Team Patient Functioning Scale allows for the specification of the changes occurring in the patient's functioning and comparing them at time intervals, and indirectly causes the Team Patient Functioning Scale to be used to draw conclusions about the aggravation, stabilization, or regression of the illness, and to prove the effectiveness of the therapeutic team. The presented results of the application of the proposed measures may constitute a reference base - as a benchmark - for the improvement and development of the quality of health services for patients in residential health care centers in Poland.\", 'OBJECTIVE. The objective of this study was to compare the receipt of preventive health services for children with and without special health care needs and to identify predictors of these health services for children with special health care needs using nationally representative data. METHODS. Data from the 2002 and 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were analyzed. A total of 18 279 children aged 3 to 17 years were included in our study. The Child Preventive Health Supplement was used to identify caregiver recall of specific health screening measures and anticipatory guidance during the previous 12 months. Odds ratios were calculated for predictive factors of preventive services for children with special health care needs. RESULTS. The prevalence of special health care needs in children aged 3 to 17 years was 21.6%. Based on caregiver reports, 87.5% of children with special health care needs had >= 1 health screening measure checked in the past year compared with 73.1% of children without special health care needs. Receipt of >= 1 topic of anticipatory guidance was reported for 69.8% of children with special health care needs compared with 55.2% of children without special health care needs. Black and Hispanic caregivers of children with special health care needs were more likely than others to report receipt of all 6 categories of anticipatory guidance measured in this study. CONCLUSIONS. We found that caregivers of children with special health care needs were more likely to report receipt of anticipatory guidance and health screening than were caregivers of children without special health care needs. Although a majority of these caregivers reported receiving some health screening and anticipatory guidance on an annual basis, there are clear gaps in the delivery of preventive health services. This study identifies areas for improvement in the delivery of preventive health services for children with special health care needs and children in general.', \"The dental hygienist team member has an opportunity to coordinate care within an interprofessional practice as an oral health care manager. Background and purpose Although dental hygienists are currently practicing within interprofessional teams in settings such as pediatric offices, hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and federally qualified health centers, they often still assume traditional responsibilities rather than practicing to the full extent of their training and licenses. This article explains the opportunity for the dental hygiene professional to embrace patient-centered care as an oral health care manager who can facilitate integration of oral and primary care in a variety of health care settings. Methods Based on an innovative model of collaboration between a college of dentistry and a college of nursing, an idea emerged among several faculty members for a new management method for realizing continuity and coordination of comprehensive patient care. Involved faculty members began working on the development of an approach to interprofessional practice with the dental hygienist serving as an oral health care manager who would address both oral health care and a patient's related primary care issues through appropriate referrals and follow-up. This approach is explained in this article, along with the results of several pilot studies that begin to evaluate the feasibility of a dental hygienist as an oral health care manager. Conclusion A health care provider with management skills and leadership qualities is required to coordinate the interprofessional provision of comprehensive health care. The dental hygienist has the opportunity to lead closer integration of oral and primary care as an oral health care manager, by coordinating the team of providers needed to implement comprehensive, patient-centered care.\", 'We investigate how utilization of primary care, specialist care, and emergency department (ED) care (and the mix across the three) changes in response to a change in health need. We determine whether any changes in utilization are impacted by socio-economic status. The use of a unique Australian data set that consists of a large survey linked to multiple years of detailed administrative records enables us to better control for individual heterogeneity and allows us to exploit changes in health that are related to the onset of two health shocks: a new diagnosis of diabetes and heart disease. We extend the analysis by also examining changes to patient out-of-pocket costs. We find significant differences in the mix between primary and specialist care use according to income and type of health shock but no evidence of using ED as a substitute for other care. Our results indicate that low- and high-income patients navigate very different pathways for their care following the onset of diabetes and to a lesser extent heart disease. These pathways appear to be chosen on the basis of ability to pay, rather than the most effective or efficient bundle of care delivered through a combination of GP and specialist care.', \"Background The recent Austrian Primary Care Act established new primary health care units (PHCUs) and obliged them to draw up a care strategy specifying their focal care tasks and objectives and emphasizing the health care needs of the population in their catchment area with its specific local health and epidemiological profile. The main purpose of these care strategies is thus to ensure that care-providers meet the local needs, but they also provide a rationale for evaluation and organizational development. To assist new PHCUs in establishing care strategies it was necessary to develop a method for automatically generating comprehensive local case studies for any freely definable location in Austria. Results We designed an interactive report generator capable of producing location-specific regional health care profiles for a PHCU located in any of Austria's 2122 municipalities and of calculating the radius of its catchment area (defined by different levels of maximum car-travelling times). The reports so generated, called regional health care profiles for primary health care (RHCPs/PHC), are in comprehensive PDF report format. The core of each report is a set of 35 indicators, classified under five health and health service domains. The reports include an introductory text, definitions, a map, a graphic and tabular presentation of all indicator values, including information on local, supra-regional and national value distribution, a ranking, and numbers of service providers (e.g. pharmacies, surgeries, nursing homes) located within the catchment area. Conclusions The RHCPs/PHC support primary health care planning, efforts to improve care-effectiveness, and strategic organizational development by providing comprehensive information on the health of the population, the utilization of health services and the health care structures within the catchment area. In addition to revealing the scope and nature of the health care needed, they also provide information on what public health approaches are necessary. RHCPs/PHC for different locations have already been distributed to numerous stakeholders and primary health care providers in Austria.\", 'Objective. To assess the role health insurance plays in influencing access to care and use of services by children with special health care needs. Methods. We analyzed data on 57 553 children younger than 18 years old included in the 1994-1995 National Health Interview Survey on Disability. The survey obtained information on special health care needs, insurance status, and access to and use of health services. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the association of insurance with several measures of access and utilization, including usual source of care, site of usual care, missed or delayed care, and use of ambulatory physician services. Results. Using the federal Maternal and Child Health Bureau definition of children with special health care needs, we estimate that 18% of US children under 18 years old had an existing special health care need in 1994-1995. An estimated 89% of these children had some form of health insurance coverage, most often private health insurance. Insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have a usual source of care (96.9% vs 79.2%). Among those with a usual source of care, insured children were more likely than uninsured children to have an identified regular clinician (87.6% vs 80.7%). Insured children were less likely to report unmet health needs, including medical care (2.2% vs 10.5%), dental care (6.1% vs 23.9%), prescriptions, and/or eyeglasses (3.1% vs 12.3%), and mental health care (.9% vs 3.4%). Insured children were also more likely to have a physician contact in the past year (89.3% vs 73.6%) and have more physician contacts on an annual basis (8.5 vs 4.1 contacts). Unexpectedly, no differences were found between insured and uninsured children in availability of after hours medical care (evenings and weekends) or satisfaction with care. We also found some modest differences in access between publicly and privately insured children. Privately insured children were more likely to have a usual source of care (97.6% vs 95.3%) and a regular clinician (91.0% vs 81.1%). Privately insured children were also less likely to report dissatisfaction with care at their usual site of care (14.9% vs 21.0%) and have access to care on evenings and weekends (6.8% vs 13.4%). No substantial differences were found between privately and publicly insured children in prevalence of unmet health needs or delays in obtaining care due to cost. Conclusions. This study illustrates the importance of health insurance for children with special health care needs. Continued efforts are needed to ensure that all children with special health care needs have insurance and that remaining access and utilization barriers for currently insured children with special health care needs are also addressed.', 'This article addresses the contribution that health care research can make to facilitating appropriate health care provision for older adults. First, the major risks in this age group are described. These include multiple illnesses, the increasing need for nursing care with age, but also the growing numbers of older adults with psychological disorders, primarily dementia. The second section of the article presents a critical assessment of the current health care situation in light of the risks identified. On this basis, the third section specifies the areas of health care research that can contribute to improving the quality of the health care provision for this population. The article is based on a presentation made by the author at the 2010 Berlin Talks on Social Medicine: The New Old - Health Care Research for a Changed Society.', \"INTRODUCTION A healthy workforce is vital for maintaining social and economic development on a global, national and local level. Around half of the world's people are economically active and spend at least one third of their time in their place of work while only 15% of workers have access to basic occupational health services. According to WHO report, since the early 1980s, health indicators in Iran have consistently improved, to the extent that it is comparable with those in developed countries. In this paper it was tried to briefly describe about Health care system and occupational Health Services as part of Primary Health care in Iran. METHODS To describe the health care system in the country and the status of occupational health services to the workers and employers, its integration into Primary Health Care (PHC) and outlining the challenges in provision of occupational health services to the all working population. FINDINGS Iran has fairly good health indicators. More than 85 percent of the population in rural and deprived regions, for instance, have access to primary healthcare services. The PHC centers provide essential healthcare and public-health services for the community. Providing, maintaining and improving of the workers' health are the main goals of occupational health services in Iran that are presented by different approaches and mostly through Workers' Houses in the PHC system. CONCLUSIONS Iran has developed an extensive network of PHC facilities with good coverage in most rural areas, but there are still few remote areas that might suffer from inadequate services. It seems that there is still no transparent policy to collaborate with the private sector, train managers or provide a sustainable mechanism for improving the quality of services. Finally, strengthening national policies for health at work, promotion of healthy work and work environment, sharing healthy work practices, developing updated training curricula to improve human resource knowledge including occupational health professionals are recommended.

However, less is known about whether postpartum health care receipt varies by the source of prenatal care.Materials and Methods: This study analyzed data from the 2011-2017 U.S. National Survey of Family Growth to examine associations between the source of prenatal care (private care facility, public/community health facility, other source, or no prenatal care) and nonreceipt of postpartum health care using weighted multivariable logistic regression models. This analysis did not require institutional review board approval.Results: Of the total estimation sample (N = 1,190), 10.8% of respondents reported not receiving postpartum health care. There were no statistically significant differences in nonreceipt of postpartum health care between women who received prenatal care from a public/community health facility or other source and those who attended a private facility. However, women who received no prenatal care had a higher likelihood of not receiving postpartum health care compared with those who attended a private facility (adjusted odds ratio 8.7, 95% confidence interval 4.3-17.5).Conclusions: Receiving prenatal care, regardless of the source, reduced the likelihood of a woman not receiving postpartum health care within a year after delivery. Interventions aimed at women who did not receive any prenatal care may be critical for improving postpartum health care use and subsequently preventing adverse maternal outcomes.', 'The care of pediatric patients with cancer and their families is complex and rapidly evolving. Despite significant advances in outcomes, symptoms of the disease and complications of therapy continue to cause suffering that may improve with the involvement of pediatric palliative care (PPC) services. This descriptive study responds to the observation of great variability in PPC utilization within pediatric oncology. Data collected from 156 health care professionals (nurses, advanced practice professionals, and physicians) from a statewide hematology alliance evaluates the knowledge, beliefs, and perceived barriers to PPC involvement. Data analysis reveals significant variability when comparing respondents from professional roles and practice environments. Despite progress in PPC availability, care delivery remains incongruent with current recommendations. Knowledge gained from this study emphasizes the important role for all health care providers in advocating for support of PPC programs, educating the public, and committing to intentional involvement of PPC services while caring for pediatric oncology patients.', \"BACKGROUND. Quantified measures of unmet health care needs can be used to evaluate health care interventions, assess the impact of managed care, monitor health status trends in populations, or assess equity of access to medical care across population subgroups. Such a measure needs to be simple, relatively easy to obtain, inexpensive, and appropriately targeted to the population of interest. OBJECTIVE. TO develop a measure of unmet health care needs that is specifically targeted to a pediatric population. SUBJECTS. Study participants consisted of children, aged 1 to 5 years (n = 1,031), and adolescent mothers, aged 13 to 19 years (n = 172), predominantly from poor, minority families in New York City. RESEARCH DESIGN. Based on a measure, the symptoms-response ratio, developed for all age groups, this study replicated Taylor's procedures specifically for children and adolescents. Respondents were asked if they had experienced a set of physical symptoms and if they saw a doctor in response. A panel of pediatricians rated the same symptoms as to whether health care should be sought. RESULTS. The measure achieved adequate inter-rater reliability and good construct validity. The children's overall use of health services did not differ from the pediatric panel's expectations, but with differing degrees of unmet needs by symptom. Adolescents sought care less often than the expert panel members believed they should. CONCLUSIONS. The symptoms-response ratio provides a good balance of a simple and inexpensive measure while yielding a fair estimate of unmet needs for primary care. This analysis created a pediatric measure targeted to the needs of young children and adolescent females.\", 'Background: Like other colonised populations, Indigenous Australians experience poorer health outcomes than non-Indigenous Australians. Preventable chronic disease is the largest contributor to the health differential between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, but recommended best-practice preventive care is not consistently provided to Indigenous Australians. Significant improvement in health care delivery could be achieved through identifying and minimising evidence-practice gaps. Our objective was to use clinical audit data to create a framework of the priority evidence-practice gaps, strategies to address them, and drivers to support these strategies in the delivery of recommended preventive care. Methods: De-identified preventive health clinical audit data from 137 primary health care (PHC) centres in five jurisdictions were analysed (n = 17,108 audited records of well adults with no documented major chronic disease; 367 system assessments; 2005-2014), together with stakeholder survey data relating to interpretation of these data, using a mixed-methods approach (n = 152 responses collated in 2015-16). Stakeholders surveyed included clinicians, managers, policy officers, continuous quality improvement (CQI) facilitators and academics. Priority evidence-practice gaps and associated barriers, enablers and strategies to address the gaps were identified and reported back through two-stages of consultation. Further analysis and interpretation of these data were used to develop a framework of strategies and drivers for health service improvement. Results: Stakeholder identified priorities were: following-up abnormal test results; completing cardiovascular risk assessments; timely recording of results; recording enquiries about living conditions, family relationships and substance use; providing support for clients identified with emotional wellbeing risk; enhancing systems to enable team function and continuity of care. Drivers identified for improving care in these areas included: strong Indigenous participation in the PHC service; appropriate team structure and function to support preventive care; meaningful use of data to support quality of care and CQI; and corporate support functions and structures. Conclusion: The framework should be useful for guiding development and implementation of barrier-driven, tailored interventions for primary health care service delivery and policy contexts, and for guiding further research. While specific strategies to improve the quality of preventive care need to be tailored to local context, these findings reinforce the requirement for multi-level action across the system. The framework and findings may be useful for similar purposes in other parts of the world, with appropriate attention to context in different locations.', \"Background: Transgender people face a multitude of health care access barriers that create wide disparities in health. Transgender people have more untreated acute and chronic conditions than the cisgender population. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to describe positive and negative experiences of transgender people when accessing health care. Methodological orientation: Qualitative methods including semi-structured interviews and content analysis for identification of themes. Sample: Nine transgender people ranging in age from 20 to 35 years who currently reside in a metropolitan area of the Southwestern United States. Conclusions: The interviews contained candid stories about the participants' health care experiences and included perspectives about provider knowledge, provider communication, and provider office interactions. Findings identified health care disparities among transgender people related, in part, to negative experiences in the health care environment. Some of these negative experiences arose from the uncertainty of providers' transgender-specific health care knowledge and anxiety about dysphoria-triggering communication in the health care environment. Implications for practice: These findings enhance practice by offering insight into how health care providers and personnel interactions influence the experience of transgender patients and help health care providers and personnel understand situations that create anxiety and dysphoria in transgender patients.\", 'Background: Asian Americans have lower cancer screening rates than non-Latino Whites, suggesting inequities in cancer prevention among Asian Americans. Little is known about inequities in cancer treatment between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer. Methods: Using the 2002-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we examined inequities in access to care and health care spending between Whites and Asian Americans with and without cancer. Our outcomes included 3 measures of access to care and 3 measures of health care spending. We used multivariable regressions while adjusting for predisposing, enabling, and need factors and estimated the mean adjusted values of the outcomes for each group. We then examined the differences in these adjusted mean outcomes among Asian Americans relative to Whites. Results: We observed evidence of inequities that Asian Americans without cancer experienced limited access to care due to a lack of a usual source of care. The likelihood of having a usual source of care was lower among Asian Americans without cancer than Whites without cancer. Inequities were not observed among Asian Americans with cancer. Compared with Whites with cancer, Asian Americans with cancer had similar or better levels of access to care. No or marginal differences in health care spending were detected between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer. These findings were consistent in both nonelderly and elderly groups. Conclusion: While Asian Americans without cancer have unmet medical needs due to limited access to care, access to care and spending are relatively equitable between Whites and Asian Americans with cancer.', 'Quality of care worries and rising costs have resulted in a widespread interest in enhancing the efficiency of health care delivery. One area of increasing interest is in promoting teamwork as a way of coordinating efforts to reduce costs and improve quality, and identifying the characteristics of the work environment that support teamwork. Relational climate is a measure of the work environment that captures shared employee perceptions of teamwork, conflict resolution, and diversity acceptance. Previous research has found a positive association between relational climate and quality of care, yet its relationship with costs remains unexplored. We examined the influence of primary care relational climate on health care costs incurred by diabetic patients at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs between 2008 and 2012. We found that better relational climate is significantly related to lower costs. Clinics with the strongest relational climate saved $334 in outpatient costs per patient compared with facilities with the weakest score in 2010. The total outpatient cost saving if all clinics achieved the top 5% relational climate score was $20 million. Relational climate may contribute to lower costs by enhancing diabetic treatment work processes, especially in outpatient settings.', \"OBJECTIVES. To determine the best predictors of the amount of children's health care use. RESEARCH DESIGN. Child health, psychosocial, and family status variables were collected. Families were then followed prospectively for 2 years to gather health care use data. Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine factors related to volume of child health care use. SUBJECTS. 367 mothers and children ages 5 to 11 years continuously enrolled in a staff model HMO. MEASURES. Child health care visits obtained from a computerized database comprised the dependent variable. Independent variables were organized into a 5-component framework including: Demographic Characteristics; Family Characteristics; Child Health and Prior Health Care Use; Child Behavior and Mental Health; and Mothers' Mental Health and Health Care Use. RESULTS. The volume of a child's past health care use was the best predictor of future health care use, with the presence of past acute recurring illnesses, child pain and mother's retrospective health care use also serving as significant predictors in the model. Analysis of a second model was conducted omitting children's past use of health care. In this model the mother's worry about child health was the best predictor of use, with child health and child and maternal psychosocial variables significantly contributing to explained variance in the model. CONCLUSIONS. This study supports prior research indicating past use is the best predictor of future health care use. In addition, the study suggests that maternal perceptions of child health and maternal emotional functioning influence the decision-making process involved in seeking health care on behalf of children. Effective management of pediatric health care use needs to address broader needs of the child and family beyond solely the child's health, most notably maternal functioning.\", 'Background: Mental health difficulties are highly prevalent worldwide. Passive sensing technologies and applied artificial intelligence (AI) methods can provide an innovative means of supporting the management of mental health problems and enhancing the quality of care. However, the views of stakeholders are important in understanding the potential barriers to and facilitators of their implementation. Objective: This study aims to review, critically appraise, and synthesize qualitative findings relating to the views of mental health care professionals on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care. Methods: A systematic search of qualitative studies was performed using 4 databases. A meta-synthesis approach was used, whereby studies were analyzed using an inductive thematic analysis approach within a critical realist epistemological framework. Results: Overall, 10 studies met the eligibility criteria. The 3 main themes were uses of passive sensing and AI in clinical practice, barriers to and facilitators of use in practice, and consequences for service users. A total of 5 subthemes were identified: barriers, facilitators, empowerment, risk to well-being, and data privacy and protection issues. Conclusions: Although clinicians are open-minded about the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, important factors to consider are service user well-being, clinician workloads, and therapeutic relationships. Service users and clinicians must be involved in the development of digital technologies and systems to ensure ease of use. The development of, and training in, clear policies and guidelines on the use of passive sensing and AI in mental health care, including risk management and data security procedures, will also be key to facilitating clinician engagement. The means for clinicians and service users to provide feedback on how the use of passive sensing and AI in practice is being received should also be considered.

This inventory should be created and processed well in advance of the planned medical excursion. The key thing to remember in one's planning is to be a health care provider during one's global health care travel and not to become a patient oneself. This article will help demonstrate the medical requirements and recommendations for such planning.\", 'Objectives Data are unavailable concerning legislation and the roles and activities of occupational health nurses in relation to health care workers. This survey was undertaken to identify these aspects of occupational health nurses and collect data on the topic in various countries. Methods A questionnaire was sent to prominent professionals in European countries and then to professionals in other countries. Results The study confirmed that very little is known about the number of occupational health nurses in this field. Training varies, but the more training they have, the more diversified their activities are. Conclusions This survey emphasizes the need to develop training and education for occupational health nurses so that they can efficiently help occupational health physicians and contribute towards assessing occupational risks among occupational health care workers, particularly in light of the lack of trained occupational health physicians.', 'Health care delivery in the United States has become complex and inefficient. With national health care gross domestic product and out-of-pocket expenses increasing, the nation has not yet improved the quality of health care compared with similar nations. As a result, the public asks for greater population health, improved patient experience, and reduced expenses. In this article, the author discuss how key stakeholders, including policy makers, health systems, patients, and employers, understand how these components of health care value are defined, interlink, and provide opportunities for improvement. The author also outlines concrete improvement opportunities from across the country.', 'Although a stated right for all Indians, equal access to health care in India is impeded by socioeconomic barriers. With its 3-tier system of public health care centers in villages, district hospitals, and tertiary care hospitals, government expenditure in India is inordinately low, with a disproportionate emphasis on private health spending. Accordingly, the poorest receive a minority of the available subsidies, whereas the richest obtain more than a third, fostering a divide in health care infrastructure across the rich and poor in urban and rural settings. This paradigm has implications for domestic Indian public health and global public health.', 'Aim: Our objective was to integrate lessons learned from perinatal collaborative care programs across the United States, recognizing the diversity of practice settings and patient populations, to provide guidance on successful implementation. Background: Collaborative care is a health services delivery system that integrates behavioral health care into primary care. While efficacious, effectiveness requires rigorous attention to implementation to ensure adherence to the core evidence base. Methods: Implementation strategies are divided into three pragmatic stages: preparation, program launch, and program growth and sustainment; however, these steps are non-linear and dynamic. Findings: The discussion that follows is not meant to be prescriptive; rather, all implementation tasks should be thoughtfully tailored to the unique needs and setting of the obstetric community and patient population. In particular, we are aware that implementation on the level described here assumes commitment of both effort and money on the part of clinicians, administrators, and the health system, and that such financial resources are not always available. We conclude with synthesis of a survey of existing collaborative care programs to identify implementation practices of existing programs.', \"Background. The ability to measure and improve the quality of children's health care is of national importance. Despite the existence of numerous health care quality measures, the collective ability of measures to assess children's health care quality is unclear. A review of existing health care quality measures for children is timely for both assessing the current state of quality measures for children and identifying areas requiring additional research and development. Objectives. To identify and collect current health care quality measures for child health and then to systematically categorize and classify measures and identify gaps in child health care quality measures requiring additional development. Design/Methods. We first identified child health care quality instruments with assistance from staff at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, experts in the field, the Computerized Needs-oriented Quality Measurement Evaluation System, the Child and Adolescent Health Measurement Initiative, and a medical literature review. From these instruments, we then selected clinical performance measures applicable to children ( aged 0-18 years). We categorized the individual measures into the Institute of Medicine's framework for the National Health Care Quality Report. The framework includes health care quality domains ( patient safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, and timeliness) and patient-perspective domains ( staying healthy, getting better, living with illness, and end-of-life care). We then determined the balance of the measures ( how well they assess care for all children versus children with special health care needs) and their comprehensiveness ( how well the measures apply to the developmental range of children). Finally, we analyzed the ability of the measures to assess equity in care. Results. We identified 19 measure sets, and 396 individual measures were used to assess children's health care quality. The distribution of measures in the health care quality domains was: safety, 14.4%; effectiveness, 59.1%; patient-centeredness, 32.1%; and timeliness, 33.3%. The distribution of measures in the patient-perspective domains was: staying healthy, 24%; getting better, 40.2%; living with illness, 17.4%; end of life, 0%; and multidimensional, 23.5% ( measures were multidimensional if they applied to > 1 domain). Most of the measures were meant for use in the general pediatric population (81.1%), with a significant proportion designed for children with special health care needs (18.9%). The majority (greater than or equal to79%) of the measures could be applied to children across all age groups. However, there were relatively few measures designed specifically for each developmental stage. Regarding the use of measures to study equity in health care, 6 of the measure sets have been used in previous studies of equity. All the survey measure sets contain items that identify patients at risk for poor outcomes, and 4 are available in languages other than English. However, only 1 survey ( Consumer Assessment of Health Plans) has undergone studies of cross-cultural validation. Among the measure sets based on administrative data, 3 included infant mortality, a well-known measure of health disparity. Conclusions. There are several instruments designed to measure health care quality for children. Despite this, we found relatively few measures for assessing patient safety and living with illness and none for end-of-life care. Few measures are designed for specific age categories among children. Although equity is an overarching concern in health care quality, the application of current measures to assess disparities has been limited. These areas need additional research and development for a more complete assessment of health care quality for children.\", 'Patient care experience surveys evaluate the degree to which care is patient-centered. This article reviews the literature on the association between patient experiences and other measures of health care quality. Research indicates that better patient care experiences are associated with higher levels of adherence to recommended prevention and treatment processes, better clinical outcomes, better patient safety within hospitals, and less health care utilization. Patient experience measures that are collected using psychometrically sound instruments, employing recommended sample sizes and adjustment procedures, and implemented according to standard protocols are intrinsically meaningful and are appropriate complements for clinical process and outcome measures in public reporting and pay-for-performance programs.', 'Patients are not outpatients or inpatients, they are ill or healthy. Integrated Health Care provides a real chance to bring scientific innovations quickly from the laboratory to patients - and being payed for that. Although guidelines therefore are no compulsory exercise, they are tools to implement evidence-based use of innovative medical means. Health care providers should be reluctant to agree in guarantees for the success of medical therapies, since medical decisions may be influenced in different ways by that. Bureaucracy may hinder the spreading of Integrated Health Care; therefore simple regulations should be preferred. Reimbursement should not be designed according to conventional systems for outpatient or inpatient care, but as defined sums of money. That makes people sure to know what kind of contract they have agreed in.', \"Introduction: Children with special health care needs are an exponentially growing population needing integrated health care programmes that involve primary, community, hospital and tertiary care services. The aims of the study are (1) to develop and validate the Special Needs Kids Questionnaire (SpeNK-Q) designed to measure parents' perspective on continuity of care for children with special health care needs and (2) to evaluate the continuity of care based on parental experiences in this population. Methods: SpeNK-Q was derived from a previous qualitative study and was based on Haggerty's constructs of informational, management and relational continuity. Parents of preterm birth children completed the 20-item SpeNK-Q at the second or subsequent planned follow-up visit after the child's hospital discharge. Principal component analysis was used to examine the structure of the instrument. Results: Principal component analysis of 101 questionnaires administered allowed us to identify five factors explaining 60.2% of item variance: informational continuity; coordination of care; continuity of family-paediatrician relationship; family support; information on care plan. Conclusions and discussion: SpeNK-Q proved to be a psychometrically promising instrument. Its utilisation could improve the identification of areas for service development, the delivery of coordinated care and support policy makers in redesigning integrated services.\", \"China has recently emerged as an important global partner. However, like other developing nations, China has experienced dramatic demographic and epidemiologic changes in the past few decades. Population discontent with the health care system has led to major reforms. China's distinctive health care system, including its unique history, vast infrastructure, the speed of health reform, and economic capacity to make important advances in health care, nonetheless, has incomplete insurance coverage for urban and rural dwellers, uneven access, mixed quality of health care, increasing costs, and risk of catastrophic health expenditures.\", \"Aim: The purpose of this scoping review was to explore the evidence on how perceptions and/or experiences of weight bias in primary health care influence engagement with and utilization of health care services by individuals with obesity. Background: Prior studies have found discrepancies in the use of health care services by individuals living with obesity; a greater body mass index has been associated with decreased health care utilization, and weight bias has been identified as a major barrier to engagement with health services. Methods: PubMed was searched from January 2000 to July 2017. Four reviewers independently selected 21 studies examining perceptions of weight bias and its impact on engagement with primary health care services. Findings: A thematic analysis was conducted on the 21 studies that were included in this scoping review. The following 10 themes were identified: contemptuous, patronizing, and disrespectful treatment, lack of training, ambivalence, attribution of all health issues to excess weight, assumptions about weight gain, barriers to health care utilization, expectation of differential health care treatment, low trust and poor communication, avoidance or delay of health services, and 'doctor shopping'. Overall, our scoping review reveals how perceptions and/or experiences of weight bias from primary care health professionals negatively influence patient engagement with primary health care services.\", 'The purpose of this paper is to describe health profiles of adolescents in foster care. The Child Health and Illness Profile Adolescent Edition clustered adolescents in foster care into 13 mutually exclusive health profiles using dimensions of satisfaction with health, risks, resilience, and discomfort. Health profiles were further characterized into four health status rankings from best to worst health status. Many reported best health status (39%); nearly equal numbers (30.6%) had profiles indicating poor or worst health status, particularly girls and those with high risk behaviors, aggression, sexual abuse, or suicidality. It is valuable to identify health characteristics of the most vulnerable subgroups of foster youth to tailor specific interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.', 'Objective: Prior studies of community health centers (CHCs) have found that clinicians supported by the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) provide a comparable number of primary care visits per full-time clinician as non-NHSC clinicians and provide more behavioral health care visits per clinician than non-NHSC clinicians. This present study extends prior research by examining the contribution of NHSC and non-NHSC clinicians to medical and behavioral health costs per visit. Methods: Using 2013-2017 data from 1022 federally qualified health centers merged with the NHSC participant data, we constructed multivariate linear regression models with health center and year fixed effects to examine the marginal effect of each additional NHSC and non-NHSC staff full-time equivalent (FTE) on medical and behavioral health care costs per visit in CHCs. Results: On average, each additional NHSC behavioral health staff FTE was associated with a significant reduction of 3.55 dollars of behavioral health care costs per visit in CHCs and was associated with a larger reduction of 7.95 dollars in rural CHCs specifically. In contrast, each additional non-NHSC behavioral health staff FTE did not significantly affect changes in behavioral health care costs per visit. Each additional NHSC primary care staff FTE was not significantly associated with higher medical care costs per visit, while each additional non-NHSC clinician contributed to a slight increase of $0.66 in medical care costs per visit. Conclusions: Combined with previous findings on productivity, the present findings suggest that the use of NHSC clinicians is an effective approach to improving the capacity of CHCs by increasing medical and behavioral health care visits without increasing costs of services in CHCs, including rural health centers.', \"People with serious mental illness have increased rates of physical ill-health and reduced contact with primary care services. In Australia, the Mental Health Nurse Incentive Program (MHNIP) was developed to facilitate access to mental health services. However, as a primary care service, the contribution to physical health care is worthy of consideration. Thirty-eight nurses who were part of the MHNIP participated in a national survey of nurses working in mental health about physical health care. The survey invited nurses to report their views on the physical health of consumers and the regularity of physical health care they provide. Physical health-care provision in collaboration with general practitioners (GPs) and other health-care professionals was reported as common. The findings suggest that the MHNIP provides integrated care, where nurses and GPs work in collaboration, allowing enough time to discuss physical health or share physical health activities. Consumers of this service appeared to have good access to physical and mental health services, and nurses had access to primary care professionals to discuss consumers' physical health and develop their clinical skills in the physical domain. The MHNIP has an important role in addressing physical health concerns, in addition to the mental health issues of people accessing this service.\", 'The primary goal of this paper is to present an analytical framework for estimating the costs of methods designed to bridge language barriers in health care. The material presented here is written for health care administrators and public health officials who are evaluating, or who expect to evaluate, the results of analyses and published studies on the economic consequences of language programs in health cave. This paper also may be seen as providing guidelines for researchers and students interested in designing and conducting economic studies of such language programs. A taxonomy of methods that have been developed to bridge language barriers in health care is discussed. Economic principles for assessing costs of these methods then are described, as well as their potential applications by health care institutions. Last, these principles are illustrated by comparing the implementation costs of two interpretive services.', \"BackgroundIntegrated people-centred health services (IPCHS) are vital for ensuring comprehensive care towards achieving universal health coverage (UHC). The World Health Organisation (WHO) envisions IPCHS in delivery and access to health services. This scoping review aimed to synthesize available evidence on people-centred primary health care (PHC) and primary care.MethodsWe conducted a scoping review of published literature on people-centred PHC. We searched eight databases (PubMed, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) using search terms related to people-centred and integrated PHC/primary care services. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist to select studies. We analyzed data and generated themes using Gale's framework thematic analysis method. Themes were explained under five components of the WHO IPCHS framework.ResultsA total of fifty-two studies were included in the review; most were from high-income countries (HICs), primarily focusing on patient-centred primary care. Themes under each component of the framework included: engaging and empowering people and communities (engagement of community, empowerment and empathy); strengthening governance and accountability (organizational leadership, and mutual accountability); reorienting the model of care (residential care, care for multimorbidity, participatory care); coordinating services within and across sectors (partnership with stakeholders and sectors, and coordination of care); creating an enabling environment and funding support (flexible management for change; and enabling environment).ConclusionsSeveral people-centred PHC and primary care approaches are implemented in HICs but have little priority in low-income countries. Potential strategies for people-centred PHC could be engaging end users in delivering integrated care, ensuring accountability, and implementing a residential model of care in coordination with communities. Flexible management options could create an enabling environment for strengthening health systems to deliver people-centred PHC services.\", 'This paper focuses on the improvement of the health characteristics in European countries including the life expectancy of their inhabitants. The primary objective is to describe, compare and analyze the status and development in the Czech Republic and other countries of the European Union in terms of the key health care indicators and population health status in relation to the economy related indicators the authors have chosen. The secondary objective is to verify the hypothesis which states that the health status of the population represented by the indicator of life expectancy is closely related to the economic level of individual countries as well as to the amount of total expenditure on health care. Based on the results of the analysis we can conclude that the Czech Republic balances on the border of the group of countries with average values of indicators and the group with poorer values. The results also suggest relatively strong ties between the economic level and health status of the population represented by life expectancy.', 'IntroductionThe promotion of health literacy of the population in a situation of migration, in the community, is a fundamental field of intervention in health promotion, for the reduction of inequalities in access to health care services. It is increasingly necessary to make health care services more equitable for migrant populations. The aim of the study was to characterize the level of health literacy of the population in a migrant situation, attending a primary health care unit in the Lisbon region, to identify priority areas for community intervention that will become the focus of intervention and contribute to the increase in the health literacy levels in this population. MethodsA cross-sectional study was carried out by applying the Health Literacy Survey (ILS-PT) to a sample of the population in a situation of migration, found by 27 participants. ResultsThe general health literacy index of the sample is inadequate (21.23 points). An analysis of the sub-indexes revealed that 75% of the participants had difficulties related to information about health care and 80% had difficulties in the field of health promotion. ConclusionsProblematic and inadequate levels of health literacy was significantly frequent among migrant population. So that enhancing health literacy among migrant is essential to reduce health inequalities to achieve better health outcomes and contribute to defense of human rights of this vulnerable population.', 'Objective. To assess the contents of antenatal care and to relate the findings to the adequacy of maternal health care Design. Cross-sectional study. Setting. Public secondary health-care facilities. Participants. Pregnant women. Interventions. Three hundred and ninety consecutive pregnant women attending 12 selected secondary health facilities were recruited proportionate to the client load recorded for each facility during the year preceding the study. Interviews were conducted using the antenatal care exit interview form of the Safe Motherhood Needs Assessment package. Main Outcome Measures. Antenatal care services provided to pregnant women in current pregnancy Results. Blood pressure measurement, abdominal palpation and detection of foetal heart rate were provided to all participants. Three hundred and eighty-six (99%) were reached with at least one educational message. One hundred and sixty-seven (42.8%) had haemoglobin or packed cell volume estimated, whereas 168 (43.1%) had urine checked for protein, at least once during antenatal visits. Routine iron and folate supplements, and malaria prophylaxis were, respectively, given to 142 (36.4%) and 25 (6.4%). Conclusions. The antenatal care service as provided had reasonable capacity for intervention against pre-eclampsia and some foetal problems, and could contribute to delivery in a health facility and by a health worker. Capacity to address the possible effects of severe anaemia and malaria in pregnancy was lacking. Equipping health-care facilities with capacity to detect anaemia and proteinuria as well as ensuring that iron and folate supplements, and malaria prophylaxis are given to all pregnant women would help to meet national guidelines and improve quality of service.', \"Breast cancer diagnosis was used as a frame for identification of the complex health care requirements. Modem health care trends in patients with breast carcinoma as well as a constant search for improvements have the implementation of health care principles for every individual patient as their goal. Breast carcinoma is not a single trauma, but a long-term and multiple trauma with stressor varying in its intensity and nature. It requests a continual medical treatment, controls, and health care in all the stages of the disease and all the therapy modalities. The opinion that the patients should actively participate in planning and realization of the activities contributes to the fact that they take over a part of responsibility during surgical, chemo and radiotherapeutic treatment, as well as during the rehabilitation process. The quality of life includes the concepts of physical health, psychological and spiritual interest, family relations, social and economic status, health care principles in patients with breast carcinoma improve the quality of life of such patients with good cooperation, connectivity and communication of the patient, members of the medical team and the members of the patient's family.\", \"Objectives: To examine utilisation of primary health care services (subsidised by the Australian Government, Medicare Benefits Schedule, MBS) before and after entry into long-term care (LTC) in Australia.Methods: A retrospective cohort study of older people (aged >= 65 years) who entered LTC in Australia between 2012 and 2016 using the Historical Cohort of the Registry of Senior Australians. MBS-subsidised general attendances (general practitioner (GP), medical and nurse practitioners), health assessment and management plans, allied health, mental health services and selected specialist attendances accessed in 91-day periods 12 months before and after LTC entry were examined. Adjusted relative changes in utilisation 0-3 months before and after LTC entry were estimated using risk ratios (RR) calculated using Generalised Estimating Equation Poisson models.Results: 235,217 residents were included in the study with a median age of 84 years (interquartile range 79-89) and 61.1% female. In the first 3 months following LTC entry, GP / medical practitioner attendances increased from 86.6% to 95.6% (aRR 1.10 95%CI 1.10-1.11), GP / medical practitioner urgent after hours (from 12.3% to 21.1%; aRR 1.72, 95%CI 1.70-1.74) and after-hours attendances (from 18.5% to 33.8%; aRR 1.83, 95%CI 1.81-1.84) increased almost two-fold. Pain, palliative and geriatric specialist medicine attendances were low in the 3 months prior (<3%) and decreased further following LTC admission.Conclusion: There is an opportunity to improve the utilisation of primary health care services following LTC entry to ensure that residents' increasingly complex care needs are adequately met.\", 'ObjectiveTo evaluate the impacts of a transition to an integrated managed care model, wherein Medicaid managed care organizations moved from a carve-out model to a carve-in model integrating the financing of behavioral and physical health care. Data Sources/Study SettingMedicaid claims data from Washington State, 2014-2019, supplemented with structured interviews with key stakeholders. Study DesignThis mixed-methods study used difference-in-differences models to compare changes in two counties that transitioned to financial integration in 2016 to 10 comparison counties maintaining carve-out models, combined with qualitative analyses of 15 key informant interviews. Quantitative outcomes included binary measures of access to outpatient mental health care, primary care, the emergency department (ED), and inpatient care for mental health conditions. Data CollectionMedicaid claims were collected administratively, and interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Principal FindingsThe transition to financially integrated care was initially disruptive for behavioral health providers and was associated with a temporary decline in access to outpatient mental health services among enrollees with serious mental illness (SMI), but there were no statistically significant or sustained differences after the first year. Enrollees with SMI also experienced a slight increase in access to primary care (1.8%, 95% CI 1.0%-2.6%), but no sustained statistically significant changes in the use of ED or inpatient services for mental health care. The transition to financially integrated care had relatively little impact on primary care providers, with few changes for enrollees with mild, moderate, or no mental illness. ConclusionsFinancial integration of behavioral and physical health in Medicaid managed care did not appear to drive clinical transformation and was disruptive to behavioral health providers. States moving towards carve-in models may need to incorporate support for practice transformation or financial incentives to achieve the benefits of coordinated mental and physical health care.', 'Background The role of socioeconomic factors as determinants of oncology consultations for advanced cancers in public payer health care systems is unknown. This study examined the association between material deprivation and receipt of cancer care among patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. Methods This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of noncuratively treated patients with GI cancer diagnosed from 2007 to 2017. Material deprivation, representing income, quality of housing, education, and family structure, was defined as quintiles on the basis of 2016 census data. The first consultation with a radiation oncologist or medical oncologist and the receipt of 1 or more instances of radiation and/or chemotherapy were measured in the year after diagnosis. Adjusted, cause-specific Cox proportional hazards competing risk analyses were used (competing event = death). Results This study included 34,022 noncuratively treated patients with GI cancer. Consultation rates ranged from 67.8% for those in the most materially deprived communities to 73.5% for those in the least materially deprived communities. Among those with a consult, rates of cancer-directed therapy ranged from 58.5% for patients in the most materially deprived communities to 62.3% for patients in the least materially deprived communities. Patients living in the most materially deprived communities were significantly less likely to see a radiation and/or medical oncologist after a diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.92) and significantly less likely to receive radiation and/or chemotherapy (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76-0.85) than those living in the least materially deprived communities. Conclusions This study identified socioeconomic disparities in accessing cancer care. Continued efforts at examining and developing evidence-based policies for interventions that begin before or at the time of oncologist consultation are required to address root causes of inequities.', 'Aim: This study aimed to identify and reach consensus among primary health care participants [registered nurses (RNs) who receive clients, directors of nursing, senior physicians, health promotion officers, and local councillors] on the types of service provider that RNs who receive clients represent in the implementation of health promotion practices in primary health care in Eastern Finland. Background: There is an increasing focus on public health thinking in many countries as the population ages. To meet the growing needs of the health promotion practices of populations, advance practice has been recognized as effective in the primary health care setting. The advance practice nurses share many common features, such as being RNs with additional education, possessing competencies to work independently, treating clients in both acute and primary care settings, and applying a variety of health promotion practices into nursing. Methods: The two-stage modified Delphi method was applied. In round one, semi-structured interviews were conducted among primary health care participants (n = 42) in 11 health centres in Eastern Finland. In round two, a questionnaire survey was conducted in the same health centres. The questionnaire was answered by 64% of those surveyed (n = 56). For data analysis, content analysis and descriptive statistics were used. Findings: This study resulted in four types of service provider that RNs who receive clients represented in the implementation of health promotion practices in the primary health care setting in Eastern Finland. First, the client-oriented health promoter demonstrated four dimensions, which reached consensus levels ranging between 82.1 and 89.3%. Second, the developer of health promotion practices comprised four dimensions, which reached consensus levels between 71.4 and 85.7%. Third, the member of multi-professional teams of health promotion practices representing three dimensions, with consensus levels between 69.6 and 82.1%. Fourth, the type who showed interest towards health policy reached a consensus level of 55.4% in this study.', 'Background: Health system weaknesses in Africa are broadly well known, constraining progress on reducing the burden of both communicable and non-communicable disease (Afr Health Monitor, Special issue, 2011, 14-24), and the key challenges in leadership, governance, health workforce, medical products, vaccines and technologies, information, finance and service delivery have been well described (Int Arch Med, 2008, 1: 27). This paper uses focus group methodology to explore health worker perspectives on the challenges posed to integration of mental health into primary care by generic health system weakness. Methods: Two ninety minute focus groups were conducted in Nyanza province, a poor agricultural region of Kenya, with 20 health workers drawn from a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a mental health training programme for primary care, 10 from the intervention group clinics where staff had received the training programme, and 10 health workers from the control group where staff had not received the training). Results: These focus group discussions suggested that there are a number of generic health system weaknesses in Kenya which impact on the ability of health workers to care for clients with mental health problems and to implement new skills acquired during a mental health continuing professional development training programmes. These weaknesses include the medicine supply, health management information system, district level supervision to primary care clinics, the lack of attention to mental health in the national health sector targets, and especially its absence in district level targets, which results in the exclusion of mental health from such district level supervision as exists, and the lack of awareness in the district management team about mental health. The lack of mental health coverage included in HIV training courses experienced by the health workers was also striking, as was the intensive focus during district supervision on HIV to the detriment of other health issues. Conclusion: Generic health system weaknesses in Kenya impact on efforts for horizontal integration of mental health into routine primary care practice, and greatly frustrate health worker efforts. Improvement of medicine supplies, information systems, explicit inclusion of mental health in district level targets, management and supervision to primary care are likely to greatly improve primary care health worker effectiveness, and enable training programmes to be followed by better use in the field of newly acquired skills. A major lever for horizontal integration of mental health into the health system would be the inclusion of mental health in the national health sector reform strategy at community, primary care and district levels rather than just at the higher provincial and national levels, so that supportive supervision from the district level to primary care would become routine practice rather than very scarce activity.', \"Background: Health financing and delivery reforms designed to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) need to be informed by an understanding of factors that both promote access to health care and undermine it. This study examines the level of health care utilisation in Timor-Leste and the factors that drive it. Methods: Data from a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of health care utilisation in 1712 households were used to develop multilevel models exploring how need and predisposing and enabling factors explain health care utilisation at both primary and secondary care facilities. Results: Need was found to be the key driver in seeking both primary care and hospital services. Rural households were less likely to go to hospital (odds ratio 0.7) than urban households. The poorest quintile was also less likely to use more expensive hospital services than other socio-economic groups. Conclusions: Understanding the determinants of seeking health care in Timor-Leste is of considerable policy significance, because health care is free at the point of use. Our findings indicate that the public resources for health care are subsidising the rich more than the poor. Health care reforms in Timor-Leste need to reduce the 'other' costs of health care, such as distance barriers, to address these inequities.\", 'To determine if prior use of health services predicts subsequent risk of unemployment and to describe the acute effects of exposure to unemployment on the use of health care services. DESIGN: Prospective population-based study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: 18,272 employed and 1,498 unemployed individuals in a Canadian province in 1986. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All cause and cause-specific rates of hospital admission and ambulatory physician contacts over the period 1983-89 were compared between unemployed and employed individuals across four consecutive time periods related to the onset of unemployment. RESULTS: Adjusted rates of hospitalisation admission and physician contacts were higher among the unemployed across all four periods. When persons with a history of mental health treatment were excluded, health care use in the period prior to the onset of unemployment was equivalent among the employed and unemployed. Controlling for mental health treatment history, all-cause and cause-specific health care use was elevated among the unemployed during the unemployment spell. CONCLUSIONS: Unemployed individuals had increased hospitalisation rates before their current spell of unemployment. Much of this difference is due to the subgroup with prior mental health treatment. For individuals without prior mental health care, hospitalisation increased following a period of unemployment.', 'ObjectiveTo assess the impact of the Health Care Homes (HCH) primary health care initiative on quality of care and patient outcomes.Design, settingQuasi-experimental, matched cohort study; analysis of general practice data extracts and linked administrative data from ten Australian primary health networks, 1 October 2017 - 30 June 2021.ParticipantsPeople with chronic health conditions (practice data extracts: 9811; linked administrative data: 10 682) enrolled in the HCH 1 October 2017 - 30 June 2019; comparison groups of patients receiving usual care (1:1 propensity score-matched).InterventionParticipants were involved in shared care planning, provided enhanced access to team care, and encouraged to seek chronic condition care at the HCH practice where they were enrolled. Participating practices received bundled payments based on clinical risk tier.Main outcome measuresAccess to care, processes of care, diabetes-related outcomes, hospital service use, risk of death.ResultsDuring the first twelve months after enrolment, the mean numbers of general practitioner encounters (rate ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-1.17) and Medicare Benefits Schedule claims for allied health services (rate ratio, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.24-1.33) were higher for the HCH than the usual care group. Annual influenza vaccinations (relative risk, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.22) and measurements of blood pressure (relative risk, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.11), blood lipids (relative risk, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.16-1.21), glycated haemoglobin (relative risk, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08), and kidney function (relative risk, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.11-1.15) were more likely in the HCH than the usual care group during the twelve months after enrolment. Similar rate ratios and relative risks applied in the second year. The numbers of emergency department presentations (rate ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18) and emergency admissions (rate ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22) were higher for the HCH group during the first year; other differences in hospital use were not statistically significant. Differences in glycaemic and blood pressure control in people with diabetes in the second year were not statistically significant. By 30 June 2021, 689 people in the HCH group (6.5%) and 646 in the usual care group (6.1%) had died (hazard ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.96-1.20).ConclusionsThe HCH program was associated with greater access to care and improved processes of care for people with chronic diseases, but not changes in diabetes-related outcomes, most measures of hospital use, or risk of death.', 'Aim. To describe health care reforms and analyze the transition of the health care system in Romania in the 1989-2001 period. Method. We analyzed policy documents, political intentions and objectives of health care reform, described new legislation, and presented changes in financial resources of the health care system. Results. The reforms of the health care system in Romania have been realized in a rather difficult context of scarcity of financial and human resources. The Gross Domestic Product spent on health care in 2000 was 4% and the number of physicians in 1999 was 42,975. The main changes due to the legislative reforms have been the introduction of a new social health insurance and strengthening of the position of family physicians. Negative effects of the reforms have been the decrease in health care accessibility and growing inequity in utilization of health care services. Health care users still pay physicians under-the-table, and have more out-of-pocket health care expenses. Conclusion. Future reforms in Romania should encourage the positive effects of current reforms: free choice of physician, autonomy of the primary health care system, and increasing financial resources for the health care system.', \"Being a family member of a patient who is being treated in an acute care setting for cancer often involves a number of challenges. Our study describes Norwegian cancer care health professionals' perceptions of family members who served as family caregivers (FCs) and their need for support during the in-hospital cancer treatment of their ill family member. Focus group discussions were conducted with a multidisciplinary team of 24 experienced social workers, physicians, and nurses who were closely involved in the patients' in-hospital cancer treatment and care. Drawing on qualitative hermeneutic analysis, four main themes describe health professionals' perceptions of FCs during the patient's in-hospital cancer care: an asset and additional burden, infinitely strong and struggling with helplessness, being an outsider in the center of care, and being in different temporalities. We conclude that it is a challenge for health care professionals to support the family and create room for FC's needs in acute cancer care. System changes are needed in health care, so that the patient/FC dyad is viewed as a unit of care in a dual process of caregiving, which would enable FCs to be given space and inclusion in care, with their own needs simultaneously considered alongside those of the patient.\", 'In Ghana, Tanzania and South Africa, health care financing is progressive overall. However, out-of-pocket payments and health insurance for the informal sector are regressive. The distribution of health care benefits is generally pro-rich. This paper explores the factors influencing these distributions in the three countries. Qualitative data were collected through focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with insurance scheme members, the uninsured, health care providers and managers. Household surveys were also conducted in all countries. Flat-rate contributions contributed to the regressivity of informal sector voluntary schemes, either by design (in Tanzania) or due to difficulties in identifying household income levels (in Ghana). In all three countries, the regressivity of out-of-pocket payments is due to the incomplete enforcement of exemption and waiver policies, partial or no insurance cover among poorer segments of the population and limited understanding of entitlements among these groups. Generally, the pro-rich distribution of benefits is due to limited access to higher level facilities among poor and rural populations, who rely on public primary care facilities and private pharmacies. Barriers to accessing health care include medical and transport costs, exacerbated by the lack of comprehensive insurance coverage among poorer groups. Service availability problems, including frequent drug stock-outs, limited or no diagnostic equipment, unpredictable opening hours and insufficient skilled staff also limit service access. Poor staff attitudes and lack of confidence in the skills of health workers were found to be important barriers to access. Financing reforms should therefore not only consider how to generate funds for health care, but also explicitly address the full range of affordability, availability and acceptability barriers to access in order to achieve equitable financing and benefit incidence patterns.', \"Background According to the World Health Organization, palliative care is one of the main components of healthcare. As the incidence of cancer is increasing in the world, home-based palliative care can be beneficial for many patients. This study was designed to explore health care providers' perceptions about home-based palliative care in terminally ill cancer patients. Methods This qualitative study was carried out using the conventional content analysis from October 2016 to September 2018 in Iran. Participants were home care providers who were selected using purposive sampling. The data were collected through 18 individual interviews, and a focus group meeting. Data were analyzed based on the method proposed by Lundman and Graneheim. Results from the data analysis, 511 initial codes were extracted, which were categorized into the two main categories of challenges and opportunities for home-based palliative care and 10 subcategories. The subcategories of challenges included deficiencies in inter-sectoral and inter-professional cooperation, lack of infrastructures for end-of-life care, challenges related to the management of death, challenges of transferring patients to home, providing non-academic palliative care, lack of political commitment of the government and Spiritual vacuum. The category of opportunities included subcategories of cost-effectiveness, moving towards socializing health, and structure of the health system. Conclusions Home-based palliative care requires government and health system support. Structural and process modification in the healthcare can provide conditions in which terminally ill cancer patients receive appropriate care in home and experience death with dignity through support of family, friends and healthcare.\", 'This paper describes models and strategies currently used in various health care settings around the country to improve health cave access for limited English-proficient (LEP) individuals and examines a spectrum of strategies that overcome barriers to care, including the use of bilingual providers, bilingual/bicultural community health workers, professional and nonprofessional interpreters, the role of written translations, and new approaches to interpretation that use technological advances. The paper also considers how these strategies are applied in a variety of health care organizations, such as community health centers, public health departments, hospitals, and managed care organizations. Specific examples of model programs and strategies in each of these health care settings are described. Finally, recommendations ave reviewed that may assist institutions in improving the provision of health care for LEP populations.', 'The aim of this study was to assess: (1) the proportion of youth with special health care needs (YSHCN) with adequate transition preparation, (2) whether transition preparation differs by individual, condition-related and health care system-related factors, and (3) whether specific components of the medical home are associated with adequate transition preparation. The authors conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the 2009-2010 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs, which surveyed a nationally representative sample of 17,114 parents of YSHCN ages 12 to 18 years. Adequate transition preparation was based on positive responses to questions about transition to an adult provider, changing health care needs, maintaining insurance coverage, and if providers encouraged YSHCN to take responsibility for health care needs. Weighted descriptive, bivariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the association between patient and health care system factors and adequate transition preparation. Overall, 32.1% of YSHCN had adequate transition preparation. Older age, female sex, income <= 400% of the poverty level, lack of medical complexity, and having shared decision making, family-centered care, and effective care coordination were associated with increased odds of transition preparation. The majority of YSHCN do not receive adequate transition preparation and younger, male adolescents with medical complexity were less likely to receive transition preparation. Different patterns of disparities were identified for each subcomponent measure of transition preparation, which may help target at-risk populations for specific services. Efforts to improve transition preparation should leverage specific components of the medical home including care coordination, shared decision making, and family-centered care.', 'ObjectiveThis study aimed to look at the practices and perspectives of residential aged care facility (RACF) care staff regarding the provision of oral health care in RACFs. BackgroundEmphasis has been placed on the provision of adequate oral health care in RACFs through the Better Oral Health in Residential Aged Care programme. Endorsed by the Australian government, this programme provided oral health education and training for aged care staff. However, recent evidence suggests that nearly five years after the implementation of this programme, the provision of oral care in RACFs in NSW remains inadequate. Materials and MethodsThis project utilised an exploratory qualitative design which involved a focus group with 12 RACF care staff. Participants were asked to discuss the current oral health practices in their facility, and their perceived barriers to providing oral health care. ResultsThe key findings demonstrated current oral health practices and challenges among care staff. Most care staff had received oral health training and demonstrated positive attitudes towards providing dental care. However, some participants identified that ongoing and regular training was necessary to inform practice and raise awareness among residents. Organisational constraints and access to dental services also limited provision of dental care while a lack of standardised guidelines created confusion in defining their role as oral healthcare providers in the RACF. ConclusionThis study highlighted the need for research and strategies that focus on capacity building care staff in oral health care and improving access of aged care residents to dental services.', 'Skyrocketing health care costs are burdening our people and our economy, yet health care indicators show how little we are achieving with the money we spend. Federal and state governments, along with public-health experts and policymakers, are proposing a host of new initiatives to find solutions. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is designed to address both the quality and accessibility of health care, while reducing its cost. This article provides an overview of models supported by the Affordable Care Act that address one or more goals of the Triple Aim: better health care for individuals, better health outcomes in the community, and lower health care costs. The models described below rely on the core principles of primary care: comprehensive, coordinated and continuous primary care; preventive care; and the sophisticated implementation of health information technology designed to promote communication between health care providers, enhance coordination of care, minimize duplication of services, and permit reporting on quality. These models will support better health care and reduced costs for people who access health care services but will not address health outcomes in the community at large. Health care professionals, working in concert with community-based organizations and advocates, must also address conditions that influence health in the broadest sense to truly improve the health of our communities and reduce health care costs. Mt Sinai J Med 79:527534, 2012. (c) 2012 Mount Sinai School of Medicine', 'Background: Almost all studies of post-acute care (PAC) focus on older persons, frequently those suffering from chronic health problems. Some research is available on PAC for the pediatric population in general. However, very few studies focus on PAC services for children with special health care needs (SHCN). Objective: To investigate factors affecting the provision of PAC to children with SHCN. Methods: Pooled cross-sectional data from Texas Department of State Health Services hospital discharge database from 2011-2014 were analyzed. Publicly available algorithms identified chronic conditions, complex chronic conditions, and the principal problem leading to hospitalization. Analysis involved estimating two logistic regressions, with clustered robust standard errors, concerning the likelihood of receiving PAC and where that PAC was delivered. Models included patient characteristics and conditions, as well as hospital characteristics and location. Results: Only 5.8 percent of discharges for children with SHCN resulted in the provision of PAC. Two-thirds of PAC was provided in a health care facility (HCF). Severity of illness and the number of complex chronic conditions, though not the number of chronic problems, made PAC more likely. Patient demographics had no effect on PAC decisions. Hospital type and location also affected PAC decision-making. Conclusions: PAC was provided to relatively few children with SHCN, which raises questions concerning the potential underutilization of PAC for children with SHCN. Also, the provision of most PAC in a HCF (66%) seems at odds with professional judgment and family preferences indicating that health care for children with SHCN is best provided in the home. (C) 2017 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.', 'Integrated care is expected to improve patient experience, patient outcomes and assist with the increasing demand on health services from those with long term conditions including mental disorder. Few studies have evaluated health care utilization as a consequence of increased integration of mental health care. This study considers the factors known to influence secondary health service utilization and investigated the impact of a locality based mental health integrated model of care (ILoC) providing specialist consultation and liaison advice to primary care, to support early diagnosis and treatment. Using existing hospital databases, the study-cohort was identified (service users supported by ILoC, and then referred within 6 months to specialist mental health services (MHS) care between 2017- 2018) and compared on health services utilization with a matched-cohort (without ILoC support before referral to specialist services). The length-of-care in the non-acute MHS was 71% shorter for the ILoC study-cohort, and differences increased in the subgroup taking antidepressants. The ILoC study-cohort was less likely to be admitted to acute MHS on first referral post ILoC intervention and had a 25% lower relative risk of acute MHS admissions at any time in follow-up. There was no difference in the average MHS inpatient length-of-stay. The risk of general hospital acute inpatient admission was marginally higher in the ILoC study-cohort. Conclusions: ILoC appears to shorten non-acute length-of-specialist-care and reduce acute mental health admission. The study provides a first step in understanding the clinical characteristics and specialist services health-care utilization of patients supported by an integrated mental care approach.', \"BackgroundChildren in the UK care system often face multiple disadvantages in terms of health, education and future employment. This is especially true of mental health where they present with greater mental health needs than other children. Although transition from care - the process of leaving the local authority as a child-in-care to independence - is a key juncture for young people, it is often experienced negatively with inconsistency in care and exacerbation of existing mental illness. Those receiving support from child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS), often experience an additional, concurrent transfer to adult services (AMHS), which are guided by different service models which can create a care gap between services. MethodThis qualitative study explored care-leavers' experiences of mental illness, and transition in social care and mental health services. Twelve care-leavers with mental health needs were interviewed and data analysed using framework analysis. ResultsSixteen individual themes were grouped into four superordinate themes: overarching attitudes towards the care journey, experience of social care, experience of mental health services and recommendations. ConclusionsExisting social care and mental health teams can improve the care of care-leavers navigating multiple personal, practical and service transitions. Recommendations include effective Pathway Planning, multiagency coordination, and stating who is responsible for mental health care and its coordination. Participants asked that youth mental health services span the social care transition; and provide continuity of mental health provision when care-leavers are at risk of feeling abandoned and isolated, suffering deteriorating mental health and struggling to establish new relationships with professionals. Young people say that the key to successful transition and achieving independence is maintaining trust and support from services.\", 'PurposeThis study compares the perspectives of rural and urban mental health clinicians working in various Washington State Community Health Centers that have implemented an integrated primary care/mental health program. MethodsWe conducted a Web-based survey of mental health clinicians (n = 71) who work in an integrated primary care/mental health program (the program) in 1 of 150 safety net primary care clinics in Washington State. Most participating clinics are Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health Clinics. Pooled survey results from clinicians working in rural settings were compared to those working in urban settings. Semistructured interviews were conducted with a subset (n = 32) of survey respondents. Comments made during these interviews were analyzed for themes. FindingsIn the survey phase, both rural and urban clinicians generally agreed that the program benefitted their patients. Rural respondents were particularly appreciative of the flexibility that the program offered when planning care. Not surprisingly, social service limitations (such as housing or transportation services) were more often mentioned as program limitations. Rural clinicians were more likely to note a lack of awareness of program resources among other medical providers on the team. ConclusionsClinicians working in rural primary care clinics value the availability and flexibility of an integrated primary care/mental health program as an option for providing mental health care for their patients. Clinicians working in rural settings could benefit from additional training and program implementation support to best meet the needs of their patients.', \"Background Self-rated health (SRH) is a single-item measure of current health, which is often used in community surveys and has been associated with various objective health outcomes. The prevalence and factors associated with SRH in Sub-Saharan Africa remain largely unknown. This study sought to investigate: (1) the prevalence of poor SRH, (2) possible associations between SRH, and socio-demographic and clinical parameters, and (3) associations between SRH and the patients' assessment of the quality of primary care. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 primary care facilities in Blantyre, Neno, and Thyolo districts of Malawi among 962 participants who sought care in these facilities. An interviewer-administered questionnaire containing the Malawian primary care assessment tool, and questions on socio-demographic characteristics and self-rated health was used for data collection. Descriptive statistics were used to determine the distribution of variables of interest and binary logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with poor SRH. Results Poor SRH was associated with female sex, increasing age, decreasing education, frequent health care attendance, and with reported disability. Patients content with the service provided and who reported higher scores of relational continuity from their health care providers reported better SRH as compared with others. Conclusion This study reports findings from a context where SRH is scarcely examined. The prevalence of poor SRH in Malawi is in line with findings from clinical populations in other countries. The associations between poor SRH and socio-demographic factors are also known from other populations. SRH might be improved by emphasizing continuity of care in primary care services.\", \"Nearly 750 000 children are currently in foster care in the United States. Recent trends in foster care include reliance on extended family members to care for children in kinship care placements, increased efforts to reduce the length of placement, acceleration of termination of parental rights proceedings, and emphasis on adoption. It is not clear what impact welfare reform may have on the number of children who may require foster care placement. Although most children enter foster care with medical, mental health, or developmental problems, many do not receive adequate or appropriate care while in placement. Psychological and emotional problems, in particular, may worsen rather than improve. Multiple barriers to adequate health care for this population exist. Health care practitioners can help to improve the health and well-being of children in foster care by performing timely and thorough admission evaluations, providing continuity of care, and playing an active advocacy role. Potential areas for health services research include study of the impact of different models of health care delivery, the role of a medical home in providing continuity of care, the perception of the foster care experience by the child, children's adjustment to foster care, and foster parent education on health outcomes.\", 'Provisions of the Affordable Care Act provide unprecedented opportunities for expanded access to behavioral health care and for redesigning the provision of services. Key to these reforms is establishing mental and substance abuse care as essential coverage, extending Medicaid eligibility and insurance parity, and protecting insurance coverage for persons with preexisting conditions and disabilities. Many provisions, including Accountable Care Organizations, health homes, and other structures, provide incentives for integrating primary care and behavioral health services and coordinating the range of services often required by persons with severe and persistent mental health conditions. Careful research and experience are required to establish the services most appropriate for primary care and effective linkage to specialty mental health services. Research providing guidance on present evidence and uncertainties is reviewed. Success in redesign will follow progress building on collaborative care and other evidence-based practices, reshaping professional incentives and practices, and reinvigorating the behavioral health workforce.', 'Primary care remains the main setting for delivery of psychiatric care. An integrated approach improves the ability of primary care providers (PCPs) to care for complex patients with behavioral health needs. This article describes integrated care and how physician associates/assistants can gain additional training to become behavioral health specialists.', 'Strengthening primary health care (PHC) is considered a priority for efficient and responsive health systems, but empirical evidence from low-and middle-income countries is limited. The stepwise introduction of family medicine across all 81 provinces of Turkey (a middle-income country) between 2005 and 2010, aimed at PHC strengthening, presents a natural experiment for assessing the effect of family medicine on health service utilization and user satisfaction. The effect of health system reforms, that introduced family medicine, on utilization was assessed using longitudinal, province-level data for 12 years and multivariate regression models adjusting for supply-side variables, demographics, socio-economic development and underlying yearly trends. User satisfaction with primary and secondary care services was explored using data from annual Life Satisfaction Surveys. Trends in preferred first point of contact (primary vs secondary, public vs. private), reason for choice and health services issues, were described and stratified by patient characteristics, provider type, and rural/urban settings. Between 2002 and 2013, the average number of PHC consultations increased from 1.75 to 2.83 per person per year. In multivariate models, family medicine introduction was associated with an increase of 0.37 PHC consultations per person (P<0.001), and slower annual growth in PHC and secondary care consultations. Following family medicine introduction, the growth of PHC and secondary care consultations per person was 0.08 and 0.30, respectively, a year. PHC increased as preferred provider by 9.5% over 7 years with the reasons of proximity and service satisfaction, which increased by 14.9% and 11.8%, respectively. Reporting of poor facility hygiene, difficulty getting an appointment, poor physician behaviour and high costs of health care all declined (P<0.001) in PHC settings, but remained higher among urban, low-income and working-age populations.', 'Integrated Health Care may possibly be a training field for efficient patient and case mangement between different providers involved. In the medium term, those instruments should be developed further so that they are no longer merely tools for cost containment, risk transfer to the providers side and competition for the good risks in health care. In the present state Integrated Health Care - as many other new regulations - means a displacement of money from health care to administration. All participants are urged to check their contracts that the benefit for patients exceeds the price of the paper.', \"Background Primary health care is a critical foundation of high-quality health systems. Health facility management has been studied in high-income countries, but there are significant measurement gaps about facility management and primary health care performance in low and middle-income countries. A primary health care facility management evaluation tool (PRIME-Tool) was initially piloted in Ghana where better facility management was associated with higher performance on select primary health care outcomes such as essential drug availability, trust in providers, ease of following a provider's advice, and overall patient-reported quality rating. In this study, we sought to understand health facility management within Uganda's decentralized primary health care system. Methods We administered and analyzed a cross-sectional household and health facility survey conducted in Uganda in 2019, assessing facility management using the PRIME-Tool. Results Better facility management was associated with better essential drug availability but not better performance on measures of stocking equipment. Facilities with better PRIME-Tool management scores trended towards better performance on a number of experiential quality measures. We found significant disparities in the management performance of primary health care facilities. In particular, patients with greater wealth and education and those living in urban areas sought care at facilities that performed better on management. Private facilities and hospitals performed better on the management index than public facilities and health centers and clinics. Conclusions These results suggest that investments in stronger facility management in Uganda may strengthen key aspects of facility readiness such as essential drug availability and potentially could affect experiential quality of care. Nevertheless, the stark disparities demonstrate that Uganda policymakers need to target investments strategically in order to improve primary health care equitably across socioeconomic status and geography. Moreover, other low and middle-income countries may benefit from the use of the PRIME-Tool to rapidly assess facility management with the goal of understanding and improving primary health care performance.\", \"Background: Hospital HIV care and public sexual health care (a Sexual Health Care Centre) services were integrated to provide sexual health counselling and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) testing and treatment (sexual health care) to larger numbers of HIV patients. Services, need and usage were assessed using a patient perspective, which is a key factor for the success of service integration. Methods: The study design was a one-group pre-test and post-test comparison of 447 HIV-infected heterosexual individuals and men who have sex with men (MSM) attending a hospital-based HIV centre serving the southern region of the Netherlands. The intervention offered comprehensive sexual health care using an integrated care approach. The main outcomes were intervention uptake, patients' pre-test care needs (n=254), and quality rating. Results: Pre intervention, 43% of the patients wanted to discuss sexual health (51% MSM; 30% heterosexuals). Of these patients, 12% to 35% reported regular coverage, and up to 25% never discussed sexual health topics at their HIV care visits. Of the patients, 24% used our intervention. Usage was higher among patients who previously expressed a need to discuss sexual health. Most patients who used the integrated services were new users of public health services. STIs were detected in 13% of MSM and in none of the heterosexuals. The quality of care was rated good. Conclusions: The HIV patients in our study generally considered sexual health important, but the regular counselling and testing at the HIV care visit was insufficient. The integration of public health and hospital services benefited both care sectors and their patients by addressing sexual health questions, detecting STIs, and conducting partner notification. Successful sexual health care uptake requires increased awareness among patients about their care options as well as a cultural shift among care providers.\", 'In light of increasing interest in evidence-based management, we conducted a scoping review of systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) to determine the availability and accessibility of evidence for health care managers; 14 MAs and 61 SRs met the inclusion criteria. Most reviews appeared in medical journals (53%), originated in the United States (29%) or United Kingdom (22%), were hospital-based (55%), and targeted clinical providers (55%). Topics included health services organization (34%), quality/patient safety (17%), information technology (15%), organization/workplace management (13%), and health care workforce (12%). Most reviews addressed clinical topics of relevance to managers; management-related interventions were rare. The management issues were mostly classified as operational (65%). Surprisingly, 96.5% of search results were not on target. A better classification within PubMed is needed to increase the accessibility of meaningful resources and facilitate evidence retrieval. Health care journals should take initiatives encouraging the publication of reviews in relevant management areas.', 'Background: Smoking, poor nutrition, risky alcohol use, and physical inactivity are the primary behavioral risks for common causes of mortality and morbidity. Evidence and guidelines support routine clinician delivery of preventive care. Limited evidence describes the level delivered in community health settings. The objective was to determine the: prevalence of preventive care provided by community health clinicians; association between client and service characteristics and receipt of care; and acceptability of care. This will assist in informing interventions that facilitate adoption of opportunistic preventive care delivery to all clients. Methods: In 2009 and 2010 a telephone survey was undertaken of 1284 clients across a network of 56 public community health facilities in one health district in New South Wales, Australia. The survey assessed receipt of preventive care (assessment, brief advice, and referral/follow-up) regarding smoking, inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol overconsumption, and physical inactivity; and acceptability of care. Results: Care was most frequently reported for smoking (assessment: 59.9%, brief advice: 61.7%, and offer of referral to a telephone service: 4.5%) and least frequently for inadequate fruit or vegetable consumption (27.0%, 20.0% and 0.9% respectively). Sixteen percent reported assessment for all risks, 16.2% received brief advice for all risks, and 0.6% were offered a specific referral for all risks. The following were associated with increased care: diabetes services, number of appointments, being male, Aboriginal, unemployed, and socio-economically disadvantaged. Acceptability of preventive care was high (76.0%-95.3%). Conclusions: Despite strong client support, preventive care was not provided opportunistically to all, and was preferentially provided to select groups. This suggests a need for practice change strategies to enhance preventive care provision to achieve adherence to clinical guidelines.', 'Objective. To study the prevalence and possible predictors for smoking during pregnancy in Iceland. Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. Twenty-six primary health care centres in Iceland 2009 - 2010. Subjects. Women attending antenatal care in the 11th - 16th week of pregnancy were invited to participate by convenient consecutive manner, stratified according to residency. A total of 1111 women provided data in this first phase of the cohort study. Main outcome measures. Smoking habits before and during early pregnancy were assessed with a postal questionnaire, which also included questions about socio-demographic background, physical and emotional well-being, and use of medications. Results. The prevalence of smoking prior to pregnancy was 20% (223/1111). During early pregnancy, it was 5% (53/1111). In comparison with women who stopped smoking during early pregnancy, those who continued to smoke had on average a significantly lower level of education, had smoked more cigarettes per day before pregnancy, and were more likely to use nicotine replacement therapy in addition to smoking during pregnancy. A higher number of cigarettes consumed per day before pregnancy and a lower level of education were the strongest predictors for continued smoking during pregnancy. Conclusion. The majority of Icelandic women who smoke stop when they become pregnant, and the prevalence of smoking during pregnancy in Iceland is still about 5%. Our results indicate stronger nicotine dependence in women who do not stop smoking during pregnancy. Awareness of this can help general practitioners (GPs) and others providing antenatal care to approach these women with more insight and empathy, which might theoretically help them to quit.', 'In Norway, the Directorate of Health is responsible for two nationwide registries - the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR) and the Norwegian Registry for Primary Health Care (NRPHC) - which together cover all governmental-funded health care. The NPR (specialist health care) was established in 2008, while the NRPHC (primary health care) was established in 2017. Data from the NPR are extensively used in a large variety of studies. We expect that data from the NRPHC will increase in importance when the registry covers a longer time period. The NRPHC will be especially important for studying conditions mainly treated in primary care and for investigation of patient trajectories. The main aim of this paper is to give an overview of the history and content of the NPR and its research possibilities. In addition, we introduce the NRPHC as a possible future research tool and the potential for studying patient trajectories when combining data from the two registries.', 'Introduction: Designing systematic, scientifically rigorous program evaluations ( PE) is 1 way to contribute to the significant need to build best practices and a stronger evidence base for integrated behavioral health care. However, there are many potential pitfalls when conducting PE in real-world settings, and many clinicians and administrators may be hesitant to engage in PE due to lack of training or resources. Rigorous PE can be achieved feasibly and efficiently. Method: This article discusses common challenges that arise when conducting PE in integrated behavioral health care settings and illustrates ways to increase the methodological quality of PE efforts using lessons learned from 2 real-world case examples. The first example included a PE of a training program for brief alcohol interventions, and the second example included a PE of a depression medication monitoring service. Results/Discussion: The case examples demonstrate the need for strategic planning beforehand, including the use of a conceptual framework as well as appropriate study designs/methodology, measurement, and the need for consistency to achieve a well-designed PE. Using the recommendations within this article, it is hoped that the quality of PEs can be improved resulting in more generalizable data that can be used to inform organizations and policymakers to improve health care delivery.', 'Massachusetts Health Reform (MHR), implemented in 2006, introduced new health insurance options that may have prompted some veterans already enrolled in the Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA) to reduce their reliance on VA health services. This study examined whether MHR was associated with changes in VA primary care (PC) use. Using VA administrative data, we identified 147,836 veterans residing in Massachusetts and neighboring New England (NE) states from October 2004 to September 2008. We applied difference-in-difference methods to compare pre-post changes in PC use among Massachusetts and other NE veterans. Among veterans not enrolled in Medicare, VA PC use was not significantly different following MHR for Massachusetts veterans relative to other NE veterans. Among VA-Medicare dual enrollees, MHR was associated with an increase of 24.5 PC visits per 1,000 veterans per quarter (p = .048). Despite new non-VA health options through MHR, VA enrollees continued to rely on VA PC.', 'Background: Negative experiences in the health care system, including perceived discrimination, can result in patient disengagement from health care. Four million US women give birth each year, and the perinatal period is a time of sustained interaction with the health care system, but potential consequences of negative experiences have not been examined in this context. We assessed whether perceived discrimination during the birth hospitalization were associated with postpartum follow-up care. Methods: Data were from the Listening to Mothers III survey, a nationally drawn sample of 2400 women with singleton births in US hospitals in 2011-2012. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds of having a postpartum visit in the 8 weeks following birth by perceptions of discrimination due to (1) race/ethnicity; (2) insurance type; and (3) a difference of opinion with a provider about care. Results: Women who experienced any of the 3 types of perceived discrimination had more than twice the odds of postpartum visit nonattendance (adjusted odds ratio = 2.28, P = 0.001), after adjusting for socioeconomic and medical characteristics. Conclusions: The postpartum visit is an opportunity for a patient and clinician to address continuing health problems following birth, discuss contraception, and screen for chronic disease. Forgoing this care may have negative health effects. The findings from this study underscore the need to reduce discrimination and improve maternity care experiences.', \"Purpose: Private and confidential health care is an important indicator of the quality of health care for adolescents. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of health care utilization and private and confidential health care among a nationally representative population of high school students. Methods: A two-stage cluster sample of 9,107 students (grades 8-12, response rate 73%) from 96 New Zealand high schools (response rate 84%) participated in a 2007 health survey using Internet tablets. Questions included when and where they had accessed health care, if their health care provider had explained that their health care was confidential, and if they had been seen in private by their health care provider. Results: Although 83% of students had accessed health care in the previous 12 months, only 27% of students reported receiving private and confidential health care. Students who had accessed health care from a school-based health center (adjusted relative risk [95% confidence interval] 1.54 [1.42-1.66]) or family planning/sexual health clinics (adjusted relative risk = 2.1 [1.9 - 2.26]) were more likely to report receiving private and confidential health care compared with students who had not accessed health care from these settings. Conclusions: While most young people access health care from their family doctor or general practitioner's clinic, rates of private and confidential health care were low suggesting that opportunities to adequately explore and respond to important yet sensitive topics are compromised in primary care settings.

However, the extent to which the resulting patterns of utilization represent high-quality care (compared to fee-for-service products) remains controversial. The authors sought to compare patterns of ambulatory care (including how diffuse or fragmented the care patterns were) for Medicaid fee-for-service beneficiaries vs. Medicaid managed care beneficiaries. A serial cross-sectional study of adults (>= 18 years old) was conducted using statewide Medicaid claims from New York State for calendar years 2010-2013. Beneficiaries were required to be continuously enrolled and have >= 4 ambulatory visits for each year they contributed data, yielding a sample of more than 1 million beneficiaries per year. Beneficiaries were characterized by age, sex, and case mix. For each year, ambulatory care patterns were compared across subgroups of beneficiaries using Poisson models (for numbers of visits and providers) and bounded Tobit models (for fragmentation scores). In 2010, among those who were not dual eligible, managed care beneficiaries had on average fewer visits (10.9 visits vs. 11.4 visits [P < 0.0001]) but more providers (3.8 providers vs. 3.3 providers [P < 0.0001]) and therefore more fragmentation (0.58 vs. 0.51 [P < 0.0001]) than fee-for-service beneficiaries, adjusting for age, sex, and case mix. These patterns persisted throughout the follow-up period and in sensitivity analyses. Less utilization is not necessarily more efficient care; a smaller number of visits spread across a larger number of providers creates more challenges for care coordination.', \"Health care education is facing common challenges of the education sector, such as ageing staff, time pressures, digitalization, and the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is part of a larger participatory international action research titled Developing Occupational Well-Being of Health Care Teachers in Estonia, 2021-2023. The objective of the study is to describe and evaluate health care teachers' occupational well-being at the pretest phase of the action research project, as well as to describe the occupational well-being development plan and related development activities at Tallinn Health Care College. The data were collected from health care teachers by an electronical survey (n = 46, response rate 46%). The quantitative data were analysed by statistical methods and qualitative data by deductive-inductive analysis. In general, the teachers were satisfied with their physical environment. Many considered their work important, and they were also satisfied with working time arrangements. Based on the pretest results, an occupational well-being development plan was created. Improving communication and ergonomics were established as the main objectives in the development strategy. These improvement activities will be part of the college's new development plan. Various activities have been planned to promote occupational well-being. These activities have already begun as seminars on communication, bullying, and ergonomics in the workplace and home office. The information can be utilized to develop long-term occupational well-being at Tallinn Health Care College. The results and good practices can enhance decision-making and education at local, regional, national, and international levels.\", 'Objective To determine whether vertically integrated hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) care is associated with more efficient use of postdischarge care and better outcomes. Data Sources Medicare provider, beneficiary, and claims data from 2012 to 2014. Study Design We compared facility characteristics, quality of care, and health care use for hospital-based SNFs and virtually integrated SNFs (defined as freestanding SNFs with close referral relationships with a single hospital) relative to nonintegrated freestanding SNFs. Among patients admitted to integrated SNFs, we estimated differences in health care use and outcomes for patients originating from the parent hospital (ie, receiving vertically integrated care) versus other hospitals using linear regressions that included SNF fixed effects. We estimated bounds for our main estimates that incorporated potential omitted variables bias. Data Extraction Methods We identified hospital-based SNFs based on provider data. We defined virtually integrated SNFs based on patient flows between hospitals and SNFs. We identified SNF episodes, preceding hospital stays, patient characteristics, health care use, and patient outcomes using Medicare data. Principal Findings Consistent with prior research, integrated SNFs performed better on quality measures and health care use relative to nonintegrated SNFs (eg, hospital-based SNFs had 11-day shorter stays compared with nonintegrated SNFs adjusting for patient characteristics, P < .001). Stroke patients admitted to hospital-based SNFs from the parent hospital had shorter preceding hospital stays (adjusted difference: -1.2 days, P = .001) and shorter initial SNF stays (adjusted difference: -2.7 days, P = .049); estimates were attenuated but still robust accounting for potential omitted variables bias. For stroke patients, associations between vertically integrated care and other outcomes were either statistically insignificant or not robust to accounting for potential omitted variables bias. Conclusions Vertically integrated hospital and SNF care was associated with shorter hospital and SNF stays. However, there were few beneficial associations with other outcomes, suggesting limited coordination benefits from vertical integration.', 'Objective - To analyse the influence of rates of general practitioner visits on rates of hospitalisations. Design - Ecological cross-sectional study of factors influencing hospitalisation rates. Aggregated data on primary care centre area level. Setting - The county of - Ostergotland, Sweden, with 3 hospital districts and 41 primary health care centres, and the hospital district of Jonkoping, in the county of Jonkoping, Sweden, with 11 primary health care centres. Outcome measure - Hospitalisation rates. Results - Age, and rates of outpatient hospital visits were the most important factors explaining the variation in rates of hospitalisations between the primary health care centre areas. Hospital districts, socioeconomic factors and rates of GP visits also influenced the rates of hospitalisations. Conclusion - When evaluating the influence of primary health care on the rates of hospitalisations, both socioeconomic factors and health care structure must be taken into consideration. Doing this, the rates of GP visits correlated negatively with the rates of hospitalisations.', \"BACKGROUND: Standard indicators of quality of care have been developed in the United States. Limited information exists about quality of care in countries with universal health care coverage. OBJECTIVE: To assess the quality of preventive care and care for cardiovascular risk factors in a country with universal health care coverage. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort of a random sample of 1,002 patients aged 50-80 years followed for 2 years from all Swiss university primary care settings. MAIN MEASURES: We used indicators derived from RAND's Quality Assessment Tools. Each indicator was scored by dividing the number of episodes when recommended care was delivered by the number of times patients were eligible for indicators. Aggregate scores were calculated by taking into account the number of eligible patients for each indicator. KEY RESULTS: Overall, patients (44% women) received 69% of recommended preventive care, but rates differed by indicators. Indicators assessing annual blood pressure and weight measurements (both 95%) were more likely to be met than indicators assessing smoking cessation counseling (72%), breast (40%) and colon cancer screening (35%; all p < 0.001 for comparisons with blood pressure and weight measurements). Eighty-three percent of patients received the recommended care for cardiovascular risk factors, including > 75% for hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes. However, foot examination was performed only in 50% of patients with diabetes. Prevention indicators were more likely to be met in men (72.2% vs 65.3% in women, p < 0.001) and patients < 65 years (70.1% vs 68.0% in those a parts per thousand yen65 years, p = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: Using standardized tools, these adults received 69% of recommended preventive care and 83% of care for cardiovascular risk factors in Switzerland, a country with universal coverage. Prevention indicator rates were lower for women and the elderly, and for cancer screening. Our study helps pave the way for targeted quality improvement initiatives and broader assessment of health care in Continental Europe.\", 'Prior research has demonstrated disparities in general medical care for patients with mental health conditions, but little is known about disparities in pain care. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality (PCQ) as documented by primary care clinicians in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). We used natural language processing to analyze electronic health record data from a national sample of Veterans with moderate to severe musculoskeletal pain during primary care visits in the Fiscal Year 2017. Twelve PCQ indicators were annotated from clinician progress notes as present or absent; PCQ score was defined as the sum of these indicators. Generalized estimating equation Poisson models examined associations among mental health diagnosis categories and PCQ scores. The overall mean PCQ score across 135,408 person-visits was 8.4 (SD = 2.3). In the final adjusted model, post-traumatic stress disorder was associated with higher PCQ scores (RR = 1.006, 95%CI 1.002-1.010, P = .007). Depression, alcohol use disorder, other substance use disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder diagnoses were not associated with PCQ scores. Overall, results suggest that in this patient population, presence of a mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care. Perspective: This study used a natural language processing approach to analyze medical records to determine whether mental health conditions are associated with indicators of pain care quality as documented by primary care clinicians. Findings suggest that presence of a diagnosed mental health condition is not associated with lower quality pain care. (c) Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of United States Association for the Study of Pain, Inc.', \"Introduction: Health care systems around the world are struggling with limited resources, in relation to the prevailing health care need. An accessible primary care is an important part of the solution for how to provide affordable care for the population and reduce pressure on the overall health care system such as unnecessary hospital stays and associated costs. As primary care constitutes an important first line of healthcare, the task of prioritising and deciding what to do and for whom lies in practice, primarily with the primary care professionals. Thus, the decisions and behaviour of primary care professionals have a central role in achieving good and equal health in the population. The aim of this study is to explore how primary health care professionals handle situations with limited resources and enhance our knowledge of priorities in practice. Methods: Semi-structured interviews with 14 health care professionals (7 nurses, 7 physicians) working in Swedish primary care were interviewed. Data were analysed inductively with content analysis. Findings: Three main categories were found: Influx of patients; Structural conditions; and Actions. Each category illustrates an important aspect for what primary care professionals do to achieve good and equal care. The influx of patients concerned what the professionals handled in terms of patients' healthcare needs and patient behaviour. Structural conditions consisted of policies and goals set for primary care, competence availability, technical systems, and organisational culture. To handle situations due to limited resources, professionals performed different actions: matching health care needs with professionals' competency, defining care needs to suit booking systems appointments, giving care at the inappropriate health care level, rearranging workhours, and passing on the decision making. Conclusion: Priorities in primary care are not, one fits all  solution. Our study shows that priorities in primary care comprise of ongoing daily processes that are adapted to the situation, context of patient influx, and structural conditions. Healthcare professional's actions for how influx of patients' is handled in relation to limited resources, are created, and shaped within this context which also sets the boundaries for their actions.\", 'ContextMassachusetts enacted health care reform in 2006 to expand insurance coverage and improve access to health care. The objective of our study was to compare trends in health status and the use of ambulatory health services before and after the implementation of health reform in Massachusetts relative to that in other New England states. MethodsWe used a quasi-experimental design with data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System from 2001 to 2011 to compare trends associated with health reform in Massachusetts relative to that in other New England states. We compared self-reported health and the use of preventive services using multivariate logistic regression with difference-in-differences analysis to account for temporal trends. We estimated predicted probabilities and changes in these probabilities to gauge the differential effects between Massachusetts and other New England states. Finally, we conducted subgroup analysis to assess the differential changes by income and race/ethnicity. FindingsThe sample included 345,211 adults aged eighteen to sixty-four. In comparing the periods before and after health care reform relative to those in other New England states, we found that Massachusetts residents reported greater improvements in general health (1.7%), physical health (1.3%), and mental health (1.5%). Massachusetts residents also reported significant relative increases in rates of Pap screening (2.3%), colonoscopy (5.5%), and cholesterol testing (1.4%). Adults in Massachusetts households that earned up to 300% of the federal poverty level gained more in health status than did those above that level, with differential changes ranging from 0.2% to 1.3%. Relative gains in health status were comparable among white, black, and Hispanic residents in Massachusetts. ConclusionsHealth care reform in Massachusetts was associated with improved health status and the greater use of some preventive services relative to those in other New England states, particularly among low-income households. These findings may stem from expanded insurance coverage as well as innovations in health care delivery that accelerated after health reform.', \"This position paper aims to increase awareness among primary care practitioners and policymakers about the specific and complex health needs of people who experience incarceration. We focus on the importance of primary care and of continuity of care between prison and community. We highlight what is known from the literature on the health of people who experience incarceration, on the organisation of prison health care, and on the role of primary care both during and after detention. We present three case descriptions of detainees' encounters with the organisation of prison health care in three European countries. Finally, we describe the position that the European Forum for Primary Care takes. Prisoners and ex-prisoners have a worse physical and mental health compared with a cross-section of the population. However, access to good quality treatment and care is often worse than in the outside situation. In particular, well-organised primary care in the prison context could benefit prisoners and, indirectly, society at large. Moreover, continuity of care between the community and the prison situation needs improvement.\", 'Facing escalating health care expenditures, the governments of countries with national health insurance programs are trying to control or even to reduce health care utilization. Little research has examined the effects of decreased health care utilization on health outcomes. Applying a natural experiment design to the Taiwan population between 2000 and 2004, which includes the 2003 SARS epidemic when an average 20% decline in health care utilization occurred, this study examines the association between a decline in health care utilization and health outcomes measured by cause-specific mortality rates. We analyse the monthly mortality rates caused by infectious diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus, nervous system diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, heart and other vascular diseases, respiratory system diseases, digestive system diseases, genitourinary system diseases and accidents. Models control for age, sex, month and year effects. Results show the heterogeneous effect of reduced health care utilization on health outcomes. Patients with diabetes mellitus or cerebrovascular diseases are vulnerable to short-term reductions in health care; compared with the non-SARS period, mortality caused by diabetes mellitus and cerebrovascular diseases significantly increased during the SARS epidemic by 8.4% and 6.2%, respectively. No significant change in mortality rates caused by the other diseases or accidents is found. This study suggests that governments of countries where health care utilization and spending are similar to or inferior to those in Taiwan should carefully evaluate the impact of policies that attempt to reduce health care utilization. Furthermore, when an area encounters an epidemic, governments should be aware of the negative consequences of voluntary restraints on access to health care that accompany decreases in utilization.', \"Evaluate health care access and experiences with care among long-term survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer relative to a comparison group in the USA. The 2008 to 2012 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys identified 1163 survivors of cancer, diagnosed ages 15-39, current ages 20-64, who were at least 5 years after diagnosis. A comparison group without cancer was matched using age, sex, and other characteristics. Primary outcomes included having a parts per thousand yen1 visit to doctor's office/clinic in the previous year and perceived health care quality (0 = worst to 10 = best; categorized as low (0-4), intermediate (5-7), and high (8-10)). Other experience-related outcomes (e.g., having adequate time with providers and providers show respect) were also evaluated. Bivariate analyses compared these outcomes between survivors and the comparison group. Multivariable logistic regressions identified survivor-level factors associated with health care visits and quality. Survivors had a parts per thousand yen1 visit more often (82.1 vs. 75.8 %, p = 0.005) yet rated their health care quality lower (low or intermediate 30.7 vs. 23.6 %, p < 0.001) than the comparison group. Fewer survivors reported always having enough time with providers (41.7 vs. 54.6 %, p < 0.001) and that providers always show respect (57.5 vs. 67.7 %, p = 0.002). Uninsured survivors were less likely to have a parts per thousand yen1 visit (odds ratio (OR) = 0.26, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.40, p < 0.001) and rated their health care quality lower (OR = 0.25, 95 % CI 0.13-0.48, p < 0.001) than privately insured. Many other factors were associated with visits and quality. Survivors of AYA cancer reported more health care visits but worse health care experiences than individuals without cancer. Targeted interventions that may improve survivors' experiences with health care should be evaluated.\", \"Introduction: This study examined the perspectives of pediatric nurse practitioners (PNPs) regarding the needs of adolescents, parents/caregivers, clinicians, and institutions in the health care transition (HCT) process for adolescents/young adults. Methods: PNPs (N = 170) participated in a luncheon for those interested in transition at an annual conference. Small groups discussed and recorded their perspectives related to health care transition from adolescent to adult services. Content analysis was used to analyze responses (Krippendorff, 2013). Results: Four themes, Education, Health care system, Support, and Communication, emerged from the data analysis. PNPs identified health care informatics and adolescents' use of technology as additional critical aspects to be considered in health care transition. Discussion: Opportunities and challenges identified by the PNPs are discussed to improve the quality and process of transitioning adolescents to adult services. This report will help National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners formulate a new Health Care Transition Policy Statement for the organization.\", 'The annual National Healthcare Quality and Disparities Reports document widespread and persistent racial and ethnic disparities. These disparities result from complex interactions between patient factors related to social disadvantage, clinicians, and organizational and health care system factors. Separate and unequal systems of health care between states, between health care systems, and between clinicians constrain the resources that are available to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups, contribute to unequal outcomes, and reinforce implicit bias. Recent data suggest slow progress in many areas but have documented a few notable successes in eliminating these disparities. To eliminate these disparities, continued progress will require a collective national will to ensure health care equity through expanded health insurance coverage, support for primary care, and public accountability based on progress toward defined, time-limited objectives using evidence-based, sufficiently resourced, multilevel quality improvement strategies that engage patients, clinicians, health care organizations, and communities.', \"This article explores the complexity of a health care system reforms in a post-conflict situation. It describes how the health care system was revamped immediately after the war, and then reorganized with Primary Health Care (PHC) as the fulcrum for change. It highlights the coordination problems, typical of a post-war situation when un-coordinated humanitarian assistance pours in. From the vantage points of Ministry of Health officials, the article details how the change process has gone over the years, the directions it has taken and the lessons learnt. It notes that reforms are often so fast that they outstrip the absorption capacity of the potential change agents because of their inadequate preparation for the new roles and responsibilities. This in turn threatens to undermine and weaken the very system that the reforms seek to strengthen. Several options adopted for change in Kosovo's health care system are at varying levels of implementation today. Some commentators have questioned if the policy for the new health care system has failed. We contend that there have been major organizational successes. But there are also shortcomings. There is also a potential danger that the health care system could partly revert to the old system. While some of the successes and shortcomings may be specific to Kosovo, many lessons learnt from Kosovo apply to health care reforms elsewhere.\", 'There is little or no role for primary care and family medicine in current health reforms in Mexico. However, robust evidence shows that primary care helps prevent morbidity and mortality and increases health equity. Mexico has participated in several international meetings sponsored by the World Organization of National Colleges, Academies and Academic Associations and the North American Primary Care Research Group that are aimed at increased understanding of national health systems and the need to strengthen primary care for improved health outcomes. From 1 of these meetings the Cancun Manifesto emerged, with a strategic plan to increase the stature and impact of the Mexican College of Family Physicians (COLMEXAC) in strengthening primary care in Mexico. We aim to describe this strategic plan and discuss its early implementation, and for this account to serve as a possible formula for other countries. The 5 specific strategies discussed are 1) the need for consensus on the leading role of the Mexican family physician in the national health system; 2) health ecology research; 3) to improve the perception of patients about the benefits of primary care and family medicine; 4) to organize meetings of health providers, users, and other stakeholders; and 5) to promote the professionalization of COLMEXAC as a legal entity.', \"Background: Despite the implementation of a mandatory health insurance (MHI) scheme in Togo since 2011, its coverage rate remains low, resulting in a high out-of-pocket payment rate. More than 10 years after its implementation, there are few empirical studies investigating the extent to which Togo's mandatory health insurance has improved beneficiaries' access to health care. Examining how MHI and healthcare use in Togo are related is the goal of this study. Methods: We use data from the Harmonized Survey on Living Conditions of Households (EHCVM), conducted in the member states of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) in 2018-2019 and covering 6,171 households in Togo. We employ multinomial logistic regression, given that the dependent variable is polytomous. Results: The results reveal a high rate of non-utilization of healthcare professionals in the case of illness, even among individuals with MHI coverage. Furthermore, the findings show that the MHI increases the likelihood of seeing a specialist physician and other formal health care professionals when sick. The results also reveal that a household's wealth is positively correlated with the likelihood of seeing formal health care professionals. Urban residents are statistically and significantly more likely than rural residents to see both a specialist physician and a general practitioner. The Grand Lome region has a statistically and significantly higher likelihood of seeing a specialist physician than the Maritime region. Conclusion :The results support the government's plan to implement universal health insurance. The government should take action to raise the standard of treatment provided to insured patients in health care centers. Additionally, the government should consider waiving medical fees for low-income policyholders. When waiving medical costs for low-income policyholders, the Togolese government should focus on the regions with the worst economic conditions. These interventions should be essential to ensure that no one is left behind. The difference between urban and rural communities should be reduced through supply-side policies that focus on rural areas.\", 'Background: There is increasing recognition in Canada and globally that a substantial proportion of health care delivered is inappropriate as evidenced by (1) harmful and/or ineffective practices being overused, (2) effective clinical practices being underused, and (3) other clinical practices being misused. Inappropriate health care leads to negative patient experiences, poor health outcomes, and inefficient use of scarce health care resources. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of inappropriate health care in Canada. Our specific objectives are to (1) systematically search and critically review published and grey literature for studies on inappropriate health care in Canada; (2) estimate the nature and magnitude of inappropriate health care in Canada and its provincial and territorial jurisdictions. Methods: We will include all quantitative study designs reporting objective or subjective measurements of inappropriate health care in Canada over the last 10 years. We will search the following online databases: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EconLit, and ISI-Web of Knowledge, which contains Web of Science Core Collection-Citation Indexes, Science Citation Index Expanded, Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Social Science & Humanities. We will also search grey literature sources to identify provincial and national audits of inappropriate health care. Two authors will independently screen, assess data quality, and extract data for synthesis. Study findings will be synthesized narratively. We will organize our data into three care categorizations: preventive care, acute care, and chronic care. We will provide a compendium of inappropriate health care for each care category for Canada and each Canadian province and territory, where sufficient data exists, by calculating (1) overall medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse of clinical practices and (2) the range of medians of underuse, overuse, and misuse for each clinical practice investigated. Discussion: This review will result in the first-ever evidence-based compendium of inappropriate health care in Canada. We will also develop detailed reports of inappropriate health care for each Canadian province and territory.', 'Background: There are significant health status inequalities in Australia between those people living in rural and remote locations and people living in metropolitan centres. Since almost ninety percent of the population use some form of primary health care service annually, a logical initial step in reducing the disparity in health status is to improve access to health care by specifying those primary health care services that should be considered as core and therefore readily available to all Australians regardless of where they live. A systematic review was undertaken to define these core services. Using the question What primary health care services should residents of rural and remote Australia be able to access?, the objective of this paper is to delineate those primary health care core services that should be readily available to all regardless of geography. Method: A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from established databases was undertaken. Relevant websites were also searched for grey literature. Key informants were accessed to identify other relevant reference material. All papers were assessed by at least two assessors according to agreed inclusion criteria. Results: Data were extracted from 19 papers (7 papers from the peer-reviewed database search and 12 from other grey sources) which met the inclusion criteria. The 19 papers demonstrated substantial variability in both the number and nature of core services. Given this variation, the specification or synthesis of a universal set of core services proved to be a complex and arguably contentious task. Nonetheless, the different primary health care dimensions that should be met through the provision of core services were developed. In addition, the process of identifying core services provided important insights about the need to deliver these services in ways that are fit-for-purpose in widely differing geographic contexts. Conclusions: Defining a suite of core primary health care services is a difficult process. Such a suite should be fit-for-purpose, relevant to the context, and its development should be methodologically clear, appropriate, and evidence-based. The value of identifying core PHC services to both consumers and providers for service planning and monitoring and consequent health outcomes is paramount.', 'Unsustainable development around the world has contributed to ecological degradation and human suffering while compromising the ability of ecosystems and social institutions to support human life. The United States health care system and its institutions are significant contributors to unsustainable development, but leaders of change are emerging from the health care arena. Health professionals, including primary care providers, are poised to serve as models for sustainability and to facilitate the necessary transformation toward more sustainable practices. Health professionals must, within a practical framework, embrace an objective definition of sustainability and then act to achieve it.', 'Purpose: The integration of mental health specialists into primary care has been widely advocated to deliver evidence-based mental health care to a defined population while improving access, clinical outcomes, and cost efficiency. Integrated care has been infrequently and inconsistently translated into real-world settings; as a result, the key individual components of effective integrated care remain unclear. Method: This article reports findings from a qualitative study that explored provider and client experiences of integrated care. We conducted in-depth interviews with integrated care providers (n = 13) and clients (n = 9) to understand their perspectives and experiences of integrated care including recommended areas for quality measurement and improvement. The authors used qualitative content and reflexive thematic analytic approaches to synthesize the interview data. Results: Clients and integrated care providers agreed regarding the overarching concepts of the what, how, and why of integrated care including co-location of care; continuity of care; team composition and functioning; client centeredness; and comprehensive care for individuals and populations. Providers and clients proposed a number of dimensions that could be the focus for quality measurement and evaluation, illuminating what is needed for successful context-sensitive spreading and scaling of integrated care interventions. Conclusion: With a mounting gap between the empirical support for integrated care approaches and the implementation of these models, there is a need to clarify the aims of integrated care and the key ingredients required for widespread implementation outside of research settings. This study has important implications for future integrated care research, and health care provider and client engagement in the quality movement.', 'OBJECTIVE: Material hardships, defined as difficulty meeting basic needs, are associated with adverse child health outcomes, including suboptimal health care utilization. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) may be more vulnerable to the effects of hardships. Our objective was to determine associations between material hardships and health care utilization among CSHCN. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study surveying caregivers of 2- to 12-year-old CSHCN in a low-income, urban area. Independent variables were parent-reported material hardships: difficulty paying bills, food insecurity, housing insecurity, and health care hardship. Dependent variables were parent-reported number of emergency department (ED) visits, any hospital admission, and any unmet health care need. We used negative binomial and logistic regression to assess for associations between each hardship and each outcome. RESULTS: We surveyed 205 caregivers between July 2017 and May 2018 and analyzed the data in 2018. After adjustment, difficulty paying bills (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.12) and health care hardship (IRR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.08-2.75) were associated with higher rates of ED visits. There were no associations between hardships and hospital admission. Difficulty paying bills (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.13; 95% CI, 1.14-3.98), food insecurity (AOR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.02-3.71), and housing insecurity (AOR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.36-5.40) were associated with higher odds of unmet health care need. CONCLUSIONS: Material hardships were associated with higher rates of ED visits and greater unmet health care need among low-income CSHCN. Future examination of the mechanisms of these associations is needed to enhance support for families of CSHCN.', 'Background We aim to investigate the costs associated with growth in the administrators, health care staff, and physicians to provide direction to establish a sustainable and cost-effective U.S. health care system. Methods Data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, particularly the Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, were utilized from 2009 to 2020. Wages and employment of medical and health service managers (administrators), health care practitioners and technical operations (health care staff), and physicians were used to calculate the total cost. Results Administrator wages have grown similarly to health care staff wages (-4.40 vs -3.01%, P = .454) and physician wages (-4.40 vs -3.29%, P = .672). Additionally, there has been a similar increase in health care staff employment (9.91 vs 14.23%, P = .269) and physician employment (9.91 vs 15.35%, P = .252) compared to administrator employment. Overall, the total growth in administrator cost is similar to the growth in total health care staff cost (6.23 vs 11.80, P = .104) and total physician cost (6.23 vs 13.02%, P = .079). In 2020, physicians had the highest employment growth but the smallest wage increase. Conclusion Although health care staff experienced a greater percent growth in employment and cost per employee than administrators since 2009, the cost per administrator remains greater than that of health care staff. Understanding differences in wages and costs is essential to reduce health care spending without compromising access, delivery, and quality of health care services.', \"Background Effective deployment of AI tools in primary health care requires the engagement of practitioners in the development and testing of these tools, and a match between the resulting AI tools and clinical/system needs in primary health care. To set the stage for these developments, we must gain a more in-depth understanding of the views of practitioners and decision-makers about the use of AI in primary health care. The objective of this study was to identify key issues regarding the use of AI tools in primary health care by exploring the views of primary health care and digital health stakeholders. Methods This study utilized a descriptive qualitative approach, including thematic data analysis. Fourteen in-depth interviews were conducted with primary health care and digital health stakeholders in Ontario. NVivo software was utilized in the coding of the interviews. Results Five main interconnected themes emerged: (1) Mismatch Between Envisioned Uses and Current Reality-denoting the importance of potential applications of AI in primary health care practice, with a recognition of the current reality characterized by a lack of available tools; (2) Mechanics of AI Don't Matter: Just Another Tool in the Toolbox- reflecting an interest in what value AI tools could bring to practice, rather than concern with the mechanics of the AI tools themselves; (3) AI in Practice: A Double-Edged Sword-the possible benefits of AI use in primary health care contrasted with fundamental concern about the possible threats posed by AI in terms of clinical skills and capacity, mistakes, and loss of control; (4) The Non-Starters: A Guarded Stance Regarding AI Adoption in Primary Health Care-broader concerns centred on the ethical, legal, and social implications of AI use in primary health care; and (5) Necessary Elements: Facilitators of AI in Primary Health Care-elements required to support the uptake of AI tools, including co-creation, availability and use of high quality data, and the need for evaluation. Conclusion The use of AI in primary health care may have a positive impact, but many factors need to be considered regarding its implementation. This study may help to inform the development and deployment of AI tools in primary health care.\", 'Objective: to map the available evidence on the main topics investigated in palliative care in primary health care. Method: scoping review type study carried out in five databases, including original articles, based on the descriptors palliative care, palliative care at the end of life, terminal care, terminal state, primary health care and their respective acronyms and synonyms, totaling 18 publications. The extraction of data from primary studies was performed using an instrument produced by the authors and which allowed the construction of the categories presented. Results: 18 publications were included in this review. Among the most studied themes are the difficulties of the teams regarding the continuity of care in the health network; the importance of in-service education by the multidisciplinary team; professional unpreparedness; bioethics; the validation and application of scales for prognosis and care for some pathologies such as cancer and diabetes; among others. Conclusion: it became evident that palliative care in primary health care has been gradually developed, but it is necessary to consider the organization of primary health care and the social policies that support or weaken it, being considered a complex challenge.', 'The health care system of the Arkhangelsk region experiences numerous difficulties. Insufficient financing, budget deficit, social tension negatively affect the health status of the population. Low birth-rate and high death-rate result in the decrease of population in number. A big number of traumas in men at the able-bodied age conditions the death-rate increase. The epidemiological situation in the region is Setting worse. It mostly refers to tuberculosis, syphilis, scabies, mental disorders, oncological diseases. The indices of the health status of children worsens. The main shortcomings of the present health care system are caused by insufficient out - patient medical aid and predominance of costly in-patient treatment. The draft of the programme on regional policy in health care, the tasks and the main trends of the reform of health care system in the Arkhangelsk region are presented for consideration.', \"Health care reform in Vermont promotes patient-centered medical homes (PCMH) and multi-disciplinary community health teams to support population health. This qualitative study describes the expansion of Vermont's health care reform efforts, initially focused on adult primary care, to pediatrics through interviews with project managers and facilitators, CHT members, pediatric practitioners and care coordinators, and community-based providers. Analyses used grounded theory, identifying themes confirmed by repeat occurrence across respondents. Respondents believed that PCMH recognition and financial and community supports would improve care for pediatric patients and families. Respondents shared three main challenges with health care reform efforts: achieving PCMH recognition, adapting community health teams for pediatric patients and families, and defining roles for care coordinators. For health care reform efforts to support pediatric patients and be family-centered, states may need additional resources to understand how pediatric and adult primary care differ and how best to support pediatrics during health care reform efforts.\", 'The precondition for implementation of decentralisation in health care is the education and empowerment of medical professionals and local politicians for management and decision-making. The decentralisation in health care has to be planned to suit the needs of regions and population (bottom-up), and not to follow the uniform model devised by the central government. The processes of decentralisation can have a negative effect on the quality of health care, increase prices and emphasise inequity in health. The poorly managed decentralisation can slow down the development and block the changes.', \"One strategy to promote workforce well-being has been health incentive plans, in which a company's insured employees are offered compensation for completing a particular health-related activity. In 2015, Providence Health & Services adopted an Advance Care Planning (ACP) activity as a 2015-2016 health incentive option. More than 51,000 employees and their insured relatives chose the ACP incentive option. More than 80% rated the experience as helpful or very helpful. A high proportion (95%) of employees responded that they had someone they trusted who could make medical care decisions for them, yet only 23% had completed an advance directive, and even fewer (11%) had shared the document with their health care provider. The most common reason given for not completing an advance directive was that health care providers had never asked about it. These findings suggest that an insured employee incentive plan can encourage ACP consistent with the health care organizations' values and strategic priorities.\", 'The literature highlights that disparities in health care performance exist. Publicly reporting data about disparities at an actionable level is needed. The Minnesota Health Care Disparities Report is designed to publicly report medical group health care performance rates for patients enrolled in state/federally funded programs. In addition, differences between patients enrolled in state-funded public programs and those in private or Medicare programs at statewide and medical group levels are presented. The endeavor is a cooperative one between Minnesota Community Measurement, an independent nonprofit community organization, and the Minnesota Department of Human Services, the state Medicaid agency. Public reporting makes transparent the gaps in the delivery of health care between patients enrolled in these programs at a medical group level and can facilitate quality improvement locally, where accountability lies and actions to address disparities can occur.', 'The Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded health care coverage and recognizes mental health as a major priority. However, individuals suffering from mental health disorders still face layered barriers to receiving health care, especially Asian Americans. Integration of behavioral health services within primary care is a viable way of addressing underutilization of mental health services. This paper provides insight into a comprehensive care approach integrating behavioral health services into primary care to address underutilization of mental health services in the Asian American population. True integration of behavioral health services into primary care will require financial support and payment reform to address multi-disciplinary care needs and optimize care coordination, as well as training and workforce development early in medical and mental health training programs to develop the skills that aid prevention, early identification, and intervention. Funding research on evidence-based practice oriented to the Asian American population needs to continue.', \"ObjectiveThe objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of China's health-care reform from 2009 to 2011 by examining Chinas annual health-care workforce statistics of 2008 and 2011. DesignThe design of the study was a secondary data analysis. Main outcome measureThe main outcome measure used was the Primary Health Care Worker Accessibility Index (PHCWA). ResultsThe statistics illustrated the impact health-care reform had on the provision of primary health care in rural areas. The results showed that the health-care reform of 2009 generally improved access to the primary health-care workforce in all 28 areas (range of increase: 13.18-324.0%). However, an increasing disparity in regional health care based on the increase of the standard deviations of PHCWA (range of increase: 36.44-77.10%) may be an issue that policy-makers and analysts will have to face. ConclusionsConcerted policy efforts from both the provincial and central governments are needed to narrow the gaps. Regional development should not only focus on the economic aspect, but also account for the fact that the adequate provision of primary health care is part of the infrastructure that makes development possible and sustainable.\", \"This paper introduces this mini-series on vertical equity in health care. It reflects on the fact that by and large equity policies in health care have failed and that there is a need for positive discrimination to promote equity better in future. This positive discrimination is examined under the heading of `vertical equity'. The paper considers Varian's notion of 'envy' as a basis for equity in health care but concludes that this is not a helpful route to go down. Better it would seem to pursue the idea from Sen of 'freedoms' and 'communitarian claims' (as raised previously by this author). While it is argued that procedural justice is to be preferred in the longer run as a basis for equity there are gains in adopting a short run goal of promoting distributive justice. Some preliminary evidence is presented on the weighting of health gains to reflect such vertical equity concerns.\", 'BACKGROUNDAn asymmetrical oral disease burden is endured by certain population subgroups, particularly children and adolescents. Reducing oral health disparities requires understanding multiple oral health perspectives, including those of adolescents. This qualitative study explores oral health perceptions and dental care behaviors among rural adolescents. METHODSSemistructured individual interviews with 100 rural, minority, low socioeconomic status adolescents revealed their current perceptions of oral health and dental care access. Respondents age ranged from 12 to 18 years. The sample was 80% black and 52% male. RESULTSPerceived threat from dental disease was low. Adolescents perceived regular brushing and flossing as superseding the need for preventive care. Esthetic reasons were most often cited as reasons to seek dental care. Difficulties accessing dental care include finances, transportation, fear, issues with Medicaid coverage and parental responsibility. In general, adolescents and their parents are in need of information regarding the importance of preventive dental care. CONCLUSIONSFindings illuminate barriers to dental care faced by low-income rural adolescents and counter public perceptions of government-sponsored dental care programs as being free or without cost. The importance of improved oral health knowledge, better access to care, and school-based dental care is discussed.']\n"
